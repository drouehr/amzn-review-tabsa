I have had visions of one of them sticking their paw in to see if they could touch it. Instead, I installed a ceiling fan in my living room to help circulate air. I have just never found the fan to do the job in a large room its lovely and tropical to look at, but the room is never noticeable cooler and, if anything, it tends to flow the warm air back into circulation. I also resisted standard fans because of the noise they make of course, I may be thinking of older models that I owned years ago. When I got the Vornado air circulator it cured everything that ailed me. The air in my living room is cool, totally circulated and the unit is quiet. In addition, I find it to be totally pet safe. I use it all the time and just love and highly recommend to everyone. Works a large size living room effortlessly!"},

I will say that it comes with a fairly large ground coffee reusable filter  its hard to find paper liners that will work  but I found the tall paper liners do work  just remember not to over fill the filter.  It uses kcups effectively.  It is quite a bit larger than others I have owned.  Its taller but you can put taller cups under the spout and wider in foot print.  I am hopeful its going to last a bit longer more than 6 months of the last one I owned.  Its mostly black plastic, the bottom strainer is a silver metal.  The loose ground filter does have the usual metal mesh. Its nice to be able to look into the water reservoir  and actually see what size of cup youll be producing by using its blue stair steps.  Its also a bit more money than I have spent in the past.  I am hoping that adds to longevity.

It didnt tear or rip when unfolding it. The mask didnt really smell like anything. I was hoping for a pleasant scent when I read the description of essential oils that are in it, but I didnt detect much scent at all, good or bad. The mask stayed in place pretty well and didnt slip. The holes lined up well with my nose, eyes, and mouth. Some masks are meant for teeny tiny faces and dont match up at all. Theres a lot of serum to rub in afterwards. I found the mask to be very chilled and refreshing without any prior refrigeration. There was no irritation to my sensitive eyes or skin. Im not sure that I achieved the results that were mentioned in the description, but my face was moisturized and felt good."},

  {"id": 57, "content": "Empire Henley type top | I am 57..  wear a 1416 or 0x1x... 38 EF  I chose the 2x because I saw a photo of gal who looked a similar size to me and the empire portion of the blouse was way too high.  I wanted the empire to fall below my bust  not be equal to it.  This was a good choice.  The empire is below my lower bust line.  Also, it is still fairly snug across the bust  but not overly so.  I was worried the body of the shirt would end up looking a bit maternity  but it is ok.  Having said that, you could totally wear this as a maternity top   it is very loose and flowy.  The back is not quite, but sort of pleated at the top of the back  the front has three buttons and lots of extra material  in other words, just like the photo  NOT snug.  It is a pull over style.  I love that the sleeves are extra long.  The arms are snug  but not overly so I am older so Ive got the larger upper arm wings The material is soft and washed and dried low tumble well.  It isnt wrinkly but I think it would be if you threw in a suitcase. The material is NOT super thick and the shirt is fairly lightweight in my opinion.  I chose the burgundy and the olivegreen.  Like them both for Fall   the burgundy is not super deep.  Sizing up in my body consideration was the right choice.

  {"id": 58, "content": "Printed robe and chemise, NO shorts  2 pc, NOT 3 pc | First, this is a TWO piece set, NOT a 3 piece robe, chemise and shorts.  Its ONLY the robe and chemise.  I am 57, usually wear a 1416 or 0x1x, I am a 38EF.  With those numbers and reading reviews, I chose the xxlarge. It was exactly right.  The chemise has adjustable straps with a lot of adjustability  numbers of inches.  Its a bit shorter than I would like, above my knee with straps adjusted about 3.  The robe is roomy, with an inner strap to tie and then the side straps that are sewn on each side  which I LOVE.  I HATE a loose tie.  The bummer is that there are NO pockets!  That is really ... Meh.  But its not a deal breaker.  I purchased to take on a cruise and I was looking for something that didnt wrinkle.  This is a PERFECT liquid nylon knit that is very easy to wash, dry and just throw into a suitcase.  I love the blackflower print.  I preferred one of the other black flower prints, but the smaller flower print was available in the xxlarge and the sizing is way more important to me. It is a slinky, comfortable and attractive on in my opinion.  I think it will be a terrific travel piece, however, with no pockets  I hesitate to purchase any others.  Also, even tho the listing notes it is a 3 pc set, it is NOT.  It is 2 pc, robe and chemise. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

I know when using this with her, I will never come home to an empty unit with Lucy over eating as I can portion her feedings at the times I wanted. I have deducted a star from this rating simply because of reading other reviews out here. I am a little leery of continuing to use this with the complaints of rubber and pets ingesting loose parts.

  {"id": 85, "content": "Heartbreakingly profound account of the Wave | I was stationed in Central Japan on March 11, 2011. At first we felt the 2.0 earthquake we were in a prefecture where small earthquakes are extremely common and laughed it off until we turned on the TV and sat in mesmerized horror at the brutality of the Wave. Many of my Japan Air SelfDefense Force wingmen were immediately mobilized for search and rescue and recovery efforts, including the monumental cleanup of Matsushima Air Base, which sustained heavy damage. The first week or so after Fukushima was  particularly nervewracking we were constantly getting radiation updates on the TV, small aftershocks happened daily, and supplies started to disappear from grocery stores first bottled water, then dairy products, then fresh produce. There was serious doubt whether TEPCO and the Japanese government were telling the truth about the scale of the meltdown and amount of radiation leaked.  When I had the opportunity to read Facing the Wave, it took me back to that time of grief and uncertainty, but also Japanese resilience. Haunting in the retelling, this was as difficult to read at times as those live Japanese TV images that will forever be burned into my memory cars and bridges swept away, giant boats stacked like toys on top of what used to be houses, whole towns wiped off the map.  Ms. Ehrlich gives a muchneeded human face and a voice to the tragedy. Told in very Zen, minimalist chapters, the book chronicles the stories of numerous Japanese who survived the tsunami from June  December 2011 everyday workers, fishermen, Buddhist abbots and nuns, elderly couples, people from all walks of life who struggle to find a new normal after they have lost their homes, possessions, and family members to the tsunami. There are months of living in crowded shelters, chronic food shortages, attempts to scrub and soak away radiation in Japanese baths, and a typhoon that dumps 17 inches of rain on an already flooded region... but as one elderly geisha relates, I lost many things, but I still have the words to the song.  The personal narratives are rounded out with snippets on the scientific background of the earthquake and tsunami, a muchneeded clinical detachment in the face of so much suffering. Snippets of haiku and pertinent quotes are featured regularly. In keeping with the books Zen aesthetics, there are no photos or illustrations other than a map of the Tohoku region highlighting many of the affected towns that the author visits during the course of her journey. There is also a very handy cast of characters listed in order of appearance at the end.  This was a profound read that captured the spirit of Japan that I know and love so well."},

  {"id": 93, "content": "Surprised by the quality for the price!! | Perfect addition to a new car purchase just made for our new teen driver! The fact this car is the same age as him it was in need of a few refreshes.. COLINOO Anti slip heavy duty mats were just the perfect addon. You can imagine what 16yr. old carpet can look like yep!! Carpet has seen better days.  I love the fact these are fully rubber and living in Utah weather.. that will come in handy to keep wet boots and snow off the floor. But, these are perfect all year round as well.. They are so ideal to take out and spray wash!!! We took car to salt flats and then to Zions National park how great to pull mats out and simply spray wash all the white salt and red sand debris a perfect solution!  Listed as heavy duty I would say these are more conducive to an all season set.. I own a heavy duty set for my own car and mat is x2 the thickness. In that regard Heavy duty only looks appropriate in winter..  it would be like wearing a ski parka in a soft spring shower! These mats give all the same elements of being fully rubber and weatherproof but, bc theyre not ber thick.. they dont look out of place and are meant for all x4 seasons!  Rolled on arrival.. we laid flat for an afternoon in the sun to undo any creases and become pliable. Following included instructions.. we used the measurement to cut along the provided gutter that creates a straight cut finish to the edge and that was it!! Mat fit into position without issue of obstructing pedals in any way. One could fasten down with double sided slip tape to hold firmly in place.. However, weve had no movement at all just placed on top of dirty carpet! For item that is not custom fit these look solid.. see photos included.  For 35 Im happily surprised how well these do the job intended.. and the ease in doing so, they surpassed all expectations. I dont hesitate to recommend if in need of a universal mat that can be used all year long. Hoping info can help make your decision.. stay safe everyone!"},

However, Nancy arrives at the airport to a lessthanwarm welcome from a ranch hand, only to find that Ed Rawley was bitten by a rattlesnake and is in hospital.  As if that wasnt enough excitement, cousins Bess and George are stranded at the airport due to bad weather, so Nancy has to explore by herself.  A phantom horse has been sighted on the ranch just before bad things happen broken pipes, downed power lines, rattlesnake bites,and its up to teenage supersleuth Nancy to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding a historical romance that unfolded on the ranch between Frances Humber, daughter of the local sheriff, and outlaw Dirk Valentine.  Before he died, Dirk buried his treasure for Frances to find using a series of hidden clues, and the treasure remains somewhere on ranch property.  Besides Shadow Ranch, Nancy gets to explore a canyon full of petroglyphs, a Native American shop, a ghost town, and abandoned cave dwellings.  There are a number of suspects Dave the ranch hand, Tex the head wrangler, Shorty the cook, and Mary Yazzie, a Native American jeweler. Nancy meets other characters over the phone, including a famous novelist, the local sheriff, and the Rawleys.  Several new features have been added, including a larger game window, which I liked, although navigating a full inventory could be confusing at times.  Nancy gets to learn about horses, barrel racing and how to use a lariat.  To get from place to place there are six major locations, Nancy rides Bob the quarter horse.  Nancy can search for information on the web with her cell phone, which provides numerous hints as to how to solve puzzles. There is a strong educational element here, as Nancy sifts through information on not only ranch life cattle branding, barrel racing, picking vegetables, feeding horses, but numerous other topics knitting, agates, petroglyphs, flowers.  I liked the nature of the puzzles, although many reviewers complained about the repetitive chores, including daily egg collecting, vegetable picking, cake baking, and feeding the animals.  Nancy is expected to help out during her visit by performing tasks for various characters, including putting together a bridle, collecting eggs and vegetables, arranging a jewelry display, and collecting arrowheads.  There are a fair number of slider puzzles and several mazes. This game is more difficult than others in the series but not as hard as Secret of Blackmoor Manor.  Secret of Shadow Ranch had a very strong story, good character development, excellent music Spanish guitar, country western, scary music in the ghost town that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, improved graphics, well integrated puzzles, and a satisfying conclusion which I didnt find in Secret of Blackmoor Manor.  Plenty of romance and suspense for young sleuths!"},

But the weather cant be too hot or too cool. Now that the heat of summer is fading, I am hoping to have some outdoor reading time soon. This hammock will be perfect for that! Its very sturdy and well made. The triple stitching is really solid and can supposedly accommodate over 600 pounds! The carabiner are ropes are strong, too. I love that this comes with hammock straps! Those really do make a difference when setting up your hammock. It gives you more flexibility as to where you hang it from. The trees we use for our hammocks have thicker trunks than what the ropes can go around. But with hammock straps, we can use a tree with a larger trunk. I also really like that the storage pouch is attached to the hammock itself, so you dont have to worry about losing it.

  {"id": 117, "content": "Aggressive Snakes and Gore | I kind of enjoyed this movie, but it was very predictable.  It was far fetched.  The snakes looked rather fake and seemed more aggressive than one would ever believe, even hyped up with pheromones sprayed on flowers in the plane to excite the snakes.  I noticed one kids review, but I wouldnt take any kids to see this movie.  Not only are there some very gory scenes there is also a seminude scene.  Shortly into the movie a guy is clubbed to death with a baseball bat and while you dont see it happen, you do see the splatter of blood coming out and all over the assailant.  Some kids are fascinated with snakes and probably wanted to see this movie, but it is not appropriate for children in any way.  Samuel Jackson is his usual charming self and was fun to watch.  Too many things here dont add up in this movie and it really takes a stretch of imagination to believe it.  The movie is so far out it is almost laughable.  I cant quite figure out who this movie was made for.  They could have done a much better job on the movie, but went too much overboard on many things.  Stuff just doesnt happen this way.  Hard to say why I enjoyed it somewhat.  I wouldnt know who to recommend this movie to.  It will probably quickly fade away as it has very little to redeem it."},
  {"id": 118, "content": "Decent Tablet for the Price | My husband used to have a high end tablet. He cracked the screen on it and never got around to replacing it so hes been without for several months. Now he has a new pink tablet. It uses standard MicroB USB connector to charge, which is good.  You can use any cable with a microB to charge it. Some other IRULU tablets use a round barrel style connector, which means you have to keep up with its special charger. He was having problems with the Wifi turning off when it goes to sleep and the only way to get it working was to reboot the tablet.  Enabling and disabling the wifi didnt work. So I contacted the seller who suggested that we do a factory reset on it. We did and that seemed to solve that problem. This tablet is slow and laggy compared to his old tablet, but thats understandable given the price difference. This runs Android 4.4, KitKat which came out in Oct 2013.  The current Android version is 6.x Marshmallow.  This means that some modern apps wont run on it as they require newer versions of Android.  Google Inbox is one that wont work. Chromecast doesnt work either, but he was able to use Google Music to stream his music through this tablet. Common apps like Youtube, Netflix, Gmail, and web browsing all work just fine, but slowly. The screen isnt as sharp as higherend tablets, but again, thats probably related to the cost.  The pink plastic casing covers the back, and comes around the sides and on the front bezel. This will help protect against breaks since theres a raised lip all around the screen. It has a TF card slot on it.  TF stands for TransFlash which is usually compatible with SD, so an SD card should work to expand the storage. The camera functions as it should.  If you are comparing it to other similarly price tablets, this one is decent. If speed is important, you may want to consider a more expensive device. I debated over giving this 3 or 4 stars. And although it does have the speed issue and the older version of Android, my husband does enjoy having a tablet again. So I went with the 3  okay and 4 I like it and chose the 4 stars.  I received this for free in exchange for my honest  unbiased review. My thoughts  opinions are my own."},

You take the role of Van Helsing, vampire hunter, on the bloody trail of Count Dracula. The game begins in London, where Van Helsing has just received a letter from Jonathan Harker.  Dracula Origin is plenty dark and gory the game is rated T, and theres certainly a lot of blood and gore including graphic torture, mutilation and satanic rituals. The games locations London, Vienna, Cairo, Transylvania sparkle and really add depth to the story puzzlewise, you spend a large amount of time in Cairo exploring the market, museum, and several residences. Sadly, the section in Transylvania felt more like a tackedon afterthought. The ending is superbrief, but I enjoyed it.  Graphics the prerendered backgrounds are generally very intricately rendered, with period touches detailed paintings, tapestries, etc.. The character animations are somewhat less successful Van Helsings movements are wooden this is a thirdperson perspective, so youre watching Van Helsing move a lot. The cutscenes are beautiful, though. Lip synching is somewhat off in cutscenes, but its generally not a distraction. The load screens are more of a watercolor wash instead of rendered and load times are short.  Sound the background music is generally unobtrusive, with a pianobased score that includes feardrenched organ and quivering strings from time to time. For some reason, the music in Cairo reminded me strongly of Big Fishs soundtrack to their Blood Ties game. Sound effects are very good. Its obvious that English was the second language there are some subtitles in particularly that dont mesh with the recorded dialogue. Also, Van Helsing got on my nerves his melodramatic, gasped Closed! at finding doors locked was grating.  Gameplay Dracula Origin is an inventorybased game. You only pick up what you need, and its generally pretty obvious what goes where although some solutions are a bit of a stretch. There are several puzzle varieties including decoding, sliders, logic puzzles, and findtheitems. The game leans towards the easy side, with plenty of handholding on many occasions, I longed for a more difficult solution. It would have been nice if two different difficulty levels had been included beginner and advanced, but I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles.  Are there some shortcuts in design and graphics that I found annoying? Yes. But Dracula Origin looks great, plays well, and is certainly one of the betterlooking adventure games to come out recently. Because of its intuitive puzzles, this is a perfect first game for those new to adventure gaming. And fans of vampire lore will find plenty to sink their fangs into as well."},

One thing I would note   I was going for a medium rare  and upped the suggested temp of 135 to 140 because I was nervous... the Meater Plus counts the resting time in the finished temp!  So, I ended up with a little to the medium than to the medium rare.  I am going to trust the Meater Plus next time.  It notifies you of when to take your food out and then reminds you when the resting is done.  You can follow the progress on the app on your phone.  Has a lovely dial that shows where you are in the cooking progress.  I am very, very impressed.  I love it.  I am eager to try it in my all natural turkey for thanksgiving!  Its just a real handy tool with a modern twist.  Its a little bit of an investment, but I think its worth it.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. UPDATED review  412021.... The more I use this thermometer the more I love it.  I have learned to trust the resting time  I have read other reviews that report overcooked food and I wonder if they might not be trusting the process.  However, could also be faulty items.  I am grateful that my thermometer has worked perfectly each time and I could not be happier.  It has taken so much stress out of my cooking life.  I wont roast without it.  Or cook a thick steak without it.  Pretty much anything you need temp on.  I am not compensated in ANY way for my reviews and I am sharing my honest experience and opinions. UPDATE 2022  Therms will NOT stay connected to device.  NO tech support.  Takes WEEKS to get a reply via email and then it is truly worthless.  I am so disappointed because they I have two pluses and a block for about 4 or 5 months and then just will NOT stay linked.  SUPER frustrating both in lack of support they say is there and then that they lasted just a few months. NOT a cheap lesson either.  I invested over 450.00 at this point.  I will sadly say I can no longer recommend these in any way."},

  {"id": 187, "content": "High energy crowd pleaser that stays true to CdS tradition | Cirque du Soleil is a uniquely Qubcois experience. What started out as a few friends performing together in summer festivals blossomed into an international corporation synonymous with imagination, feats to dazzle the senses, music to astound the ears and costumes to dazzle the eyes. Cirques motto is quotInvoquer limaginaire, provoquer les sens, voquer lmotion,quot or quotinvoke the imagination, provoke the senses, evoke the emotions,quot and Dralion delivers on all these counts. Dralion is CdSs twelveth production and is a blend of East and West. The majority of the cast is Chinese, and the acts incorporate traditional Chinese circus acts with Cirque favourites. The costumes range from African to Indian to Chinese, and the lead singers rik Karol and Agnes Sohier represent a godlike figure, lme Force, and as such they have the most extravagant costumes. Originally rik did all of the singing in Dralion but Agnes was added as the tour progressed. rik has since left Dralion and has been replaced by Frank Irving. The role of lme Force was created around riks unique countertenor voice, which is put to stunning effect in songs such as quotStella Errans,quot and quotHinkoquot where he switches from head to chest voice at the drop of a hat. quotBallarequot is a beautiful slow balladduet that accompanies one of the most stunning acts in Dralion an aerial pas de deux in which the two performers are suspended from the ceiling by only a length of blue silk which they wrap around themselves. The Dralion soundtrack is also available for purchase it is my favourite CdS soundtrack ever! and recently won two awards from Billboard for being a top World Music album for 2001. All of the acts are sure to keep you entertained, and the bright colours and silly dralions keep kids attentions as well. And yes, there are clowns. A new breed of clowns, evidently. In keeping with the Cirque tradition of quotReinventing the Circusquot these clowns dont squeeze into cars. They dont wear flowers that squirt water. They do pick on audience members rather mercilessly at times, but its part of the fun. The behindthescenes documentary was excellent, with lots of rehearsal footage and interviews with the composer, producer, and many of the cast. And the alternate camera angles made the show interactive! Dralion won two Emmy Awards for best show, and its easy to see why. A fascinating fusion of world cultures. If you cant make it to a Cirque du Soleil show live, this DVD is the next best thing!"},

Jon has just been released prematurely from what was to be a three year sentence.  He brutally assaulted Allison in a drunken rage and now word is he is going to kill her.

Hannahs teenagerness and belief in her father until she doesnt teen resistance to her mothers efforts to protect her or actually evil? and ultimately, Shaws relationship to the various tendrils of the investigation and his protection responsibilities.

  {"id": 230, "content": "Lucky Peach a good if basic guide to Asian and Asianinspired cuisine | Im fairly new to the Lucky Peach magazine I recently used the LP article The Meaning of Mangoes with my advanced ESL students and just spent six months working and cooking  eating my way across Taiwan, so I was thrilled to see that Lucky Peach had a cookbook coming out. Lucky Peach Presents 101 Easy Asian Recipes is true to its title beginning with a genius illustrated guide to the Asian pantry presented in basic, intermediate, and champion levels, this book will help you take baby steps to becoming proficient with Asian tools, ingredients and cooking methods. Do note that if you are even passingly familiar with basic cooking techniques and Asian cooking in general, this book is likely a little simpler than you are looking for, but it would be great for college students and those new to the kitchen.  The book is based on two main rules no frying, and no subrecipes.  Beginning with cold dishes, appetizers and pickly bits, youll find classics like garlicsmashed cucumbers, seaweed salad, soy sauce eggs, green papaya salad, and dumplings. I was a little surprised not to see the ubiquitous Taiwanese tea eggs make an appearance. I was also hoping for a chapter of standalone egg dishes like chawanmushi steamed egg custard also found in Taiwan as I am a firm believer in breakfast for dinner, but there are several substantial egg dishes throughout the book omurice, dashiaki tamago, egg foo young.  Pancakes include Japanese okonomiyaki, Taiwan  China contributes scallion pancakes my favorite Taiwanese snack handsdown!, and there are several Korean pancakes in addition to moo shu pancakes and vegetables. Soups and stews offer some rather surprising combinations like miso clam chowder and rotisserie chicken ramen youll also find a slowcooker pho, vegetarian hot pot and Massaman curry.  Noodles include soba, jap chae, pad see ew, pesto ramen, and spicy mushroom ragu. Having lived in Japan and Taiwan and having sampled numerous excellent noodle dishes in both, I was honestly expecting more from the noodle chapter. Where is udon? Cold sesame noodles? Many types of noodles are covered in the discussion in ingredients, but not used in later chapters.  I was more enthused about the rice dishes ume and kabocha rice, onigiri, omurice and sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves are all dishes I can see myself making frequently. I was surprised that there werent more Taiwanese  Thaistyle fried rice recipes, although there is a basic 34build your own34 guide to adding sauce and extras. Vegetarians will delight in the simple yet tasty veggie options, including misoglazed eggplant one of my favorite ways to prepare it, stirfried asparagus, bok choy with oyster sauce you can find vegetarian oyster sauce in larger Asian supermarkets, dryfried green beans, roasted squash with red glaze, and roasted sweet potatoes.  The book really shines in its treatment of poultry and meat dishes I felt it was much more successful than the noodle dishes. Youll find twelve chicken recipes ranging from Japanese oyakodon, Filipino chicken adobo, Korean, and Chinese fivespice, lacquered, Hainan Chicken rice, Chinese chicken salad.  The dressings and sauces chapter was very handy I love the carrotginger dressing, two ginger scallion sauces, tofu dressing, and the odd flavor sauce. Curiously, the desserts chapter only offered two recipes oranges, and egg custard tarts. Yes, I get that in traditional Chinese culture, dessert may consist of fruit in Taiwan, if you are visiting someones home, fruit is always brought as a gift. However, seeing the heavy Thai  Vietnamese  Japanese influence in other chapters, Im surprised that more Asian sweets werent included mangoes with sticky rice, green tea infused desserts, etc.. Several chapters suffered from similar brevity the breakfast chapter only includes four recipes again, I was surprised not to see congee here as it can be made in a rice cooker. It also took some getting used to that the notes came after the recipes.  Overall, this is a good first cookbook if you are new to Asian cuisine the illustrated pantry guide is immensely helpful if you are new to these ingredients and trying to locate them in an Asian supermarket. Its also very handy for quick pickles, basic dumplings using premade wrappers, etc. Illustrations for slightly trickier dishes like dashimaki tamago and dumplings are very helpful. However, I felt like it could have had so much more potential given the huge range of variety and influences in Asian cuisine.  I received this book through Blogging for Books"},

Students Across the Seven Seas series focuses on the lives of several female high school students that are studying abroad for a semester. In When Irish Guys Are Smiling, Delk Sinclair escapes Nashville for Connemara after struggling with the recent death of her mother and her fathers remarriage to a very young now pregnant bride whos determined to strip every trace of Delks mother during the renovation of her house. Delk cant bear the thought of her presentation to Nashville society without her mother to help her, and is tired of her friends pity and shallow lives.  In Connemara, she studies Irish history and culture at Tremain Castle along with several other American students upandcoming model Latreece, whos dying to model in Paris despite her mothers wishes, the triplets Lucy, Brent and Trent from New Hampshire, and sports jock Iris. Throughout the story, all of the students are changed by their time in Ireland and their newfound connections with Irish culture, from sheepshearing to pub nights to a camping trip to the Aran Isles. Delk even finds romance in the form of Pather, whos attending college parttime and working on his fathers farm.

  {"id": 233, "content": "Not for everyone | This is a really fun album with a unique bouncy sound.  Some reviewers say its like swing and not a very good imitation of swing.  Others say it was never intended to be swing or to imitate it.  It doesnt really matter what you call it.  Its very listenable and lots of fun.  If you are stuck in a groove and only like a certain type of music, this might not be for you, but if you are like me and you like all good music, this album is a joy to listen to.  I think I agree with some of the reviewers that it is a mixing of styles and the zippers have their own unique sound.  If you want an album that sounds like every other album out there, dont buy this.  If you want something a little offbeat and different, get this and dont think twice about it, as you will enjoy it.  The album moves along rapidly and it was over with before I realized it.  It sounds like the band is having an absolutely wonderful time playing and arent worried about perfection.  That makes it much more enjoyable and it doesnt sound overproduced, like so many albums.  Its more like live music as we all know live is almost always better than recorded."},

I really like that it came with a small, drawstring bag to keep all the pieces and user manual in along with the shaver.  You get 2 spare shaver blades, a small brush to clean the blade and blade cover.  The shaver also comes with a cover for the shaver head.  I also really like that when you want to get in and clean the blade and inside of the shaver  its a TWIST off access.  Super easy and then you also know that it is securely back on with the twist back on.  The onoff switch has two speeds one slower 1 one faster 2  I always use the faster  but I am not doing fine sweaters or anything.  However, IF you ARE doing something finer, there is also a guide that you can put on the shaver head to make sure youre not getting too close. Not sure I would ever use the guide, but its included.  Its comfortable to hold and use  if you have a very small hand  maybe not so.  The fuzz holder is smokey clear plastic so you can easily seen when you need to empty it  which is also easy to do.

  {"id": 258, "content": "Meltdown  Nuclear and Personal | 34Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands34 is a book you will not soon forget.  Set in the present or possibly near future in Vermont, it concerns a meltdown at a nuclear plant think Japans Fukushima Daiichi in 2011 that has a predictably searing effect on the main character, 16yearold Emily Shepard, whose parents are implicated in the accident and are both killed.  As the book opens, Emily is homeless, living in an igloo she has constructed of trash bags and wet leaves with a nineyearold companion, Cameron.  How she got here is the subject of the book, and it is a coming of age tale for the ages.  I will not spoil the book by revealing too much, but you should know that Emily goes through the tortures of the damned in so many ways  physically, psychologically, spiritually.  Imagine months of life on the streets of Burlington for a homeless teenage girl, and you will not be far off the mark.  Emily is a marvel, however.  She is by turns and all at once insightful, childlike, hopeful, cynical, intelligent, honest, deceitful, passionate, caring, lost, and found.  She quotes Emily Dickinson at length and often, and shows uncanny insight.  The author, Chris Bohjalian, has a pitchperfect ear for the bright but disillusioned teenage girl voice, and this is evident from page one.  To be fair, he credits his young adult daughter for her help in achieving this.  Still, it is amazing.  If this book interests you, I recommend that you listen to the NPR interview with the author conducted by Diane Rehm in July of 2014.  You can find it on the Diane Rehm website and listen to the entire thing or read a transcript.  I recommend listening.  In that interview, I was surprised to learn that the author did not envision this as a YA novel.  Although much of the subject matter is very adult, this is not unusual for todays YA literary scene, and I thought from the first that this book would be the next new thing in YA literature.  That said, I can see it as an adult novel as well, one that adults and teens might profitably discuss together.  Hats off to Chris Bohjalian for creating Emily and letting her tell her story.  This is a novel you wont want to miss.  Highly recommended for everyone from mature teens to adults."},

After reading The Witch of Willow Hall, I knew that Hester Fox would become a staple author on my bookshelves, and The Widow of Pale Harbor has cemented that. For me, Hester Foxs writing is up there with some of the bestloved scream queens of gothic literature such as Mary Shelley, A. M. Barnard and the Bront sisters.  A castle by the sea, ravens, gothic romance, and dark secrets all wrapped up in the scenery of an eerie New England townoh, be still my beating heart! This is the stuff that all novels should be made of. The book opens with an injured raven at the foot of Castle Carver, the home of one of the books main characters, Sophronia Carver. This is the fourth bird to turn up dead or in this ones case near dead at the steps of her home, and Sophronia is beginning to suspect that there may be a dark reason behind this strange coincidence. As a storm begins to roll in over the Atlantic, she retreats back into the large house to watch it from the upper window. But this particular storm is different she could feel it reverberating in her bones. Perhaps the raven had been a harbinger of things to come, an omen  The book expertly flits between two points of view. That of Sophronia Carver and a second character that we are introduced to in chapter two, Gabriel Stone. The duel viewpoints add depth to the story, but at no point do they complicate it or stop its flow. This is an incredibly easy read that you will not want to put down due to the suspense from beginning to end. So cozy up under the covers with a cup of tea and enjoy this fantastic fall read, just in time for the spooky season!"},

If you go to the fitbit site, they will change you separately for each of those  so its nice to not have to pull that connector out every time you want to change the color of your band.

  {"id": 290, "content": "A gritty, edgy homage to Kafka and Lynch that still packs a wallop 10 years later! | Pulse Entertainments Bad Mojo was originally released in 1995 to rave reviews.  This gritty tale of betrayal and dark secrets was based in part upon Franz Kafkas Metamorphosis and the styling of David Lynch. The protagonist is Roger Samms, a nerdy entomologist bent on revenge who is mysteriously transformed into a cockroach.  Roger lives in a seedy waterfront dive in San Francisco, and you play Roger in roach form as he scurries and scuttles through the various rooms.  You can only access one room at a time, and each area reveals clues to Rogers past in the form of interactive photos, flashback movies, and riddles delivered by an oracle.  Although the game is over 10 years old, the visuals, sound, effects and level of detail is still amazing.  The original miniature FMV videos are remastered and now nearly full screen, and instead of the original 256 colors, the rerelease runs in true color.  You must avoid ordinary objects that mean death to roaches oil spills, wet paint, gas burners, and other animals spiders, cats and rats intent on having you as their next meal.  Along the way, other insects and animals will give you hints on how to solve the many puzzles integrated into the gaming environment.  Although Bad Mojo is only rated T for Teen, the game contains numerous grossouts by design, and is not for the squeamish.  Rotting food, maggotinfested raw meat, sewage, and bloody fish and rats are shown in all their fullscreen, photorealistic glory or is that gory?.  They do add to the atmosphere of the dark, seedy world of Eddies Bar, but consider yourself forewarned if the sight of moldy TV dinners, filthy toilets and roachinfested buildings send you into spasms.  An added bonus is the included DVD that features an indepth Making of Bad Mojo, featuring detailed interviews with many of the games designers, artists and producers, footage from filming the games videos, concept art, storyboards and video hints to each level.  An absolute gem with a unique premise, addictive gameplay and an unusual storyline to say the least, this Bad Mojo rerelease is a perfect holiday gift from Pulse Entertainment, since the original version from 1995 is outofprint and wont run on Windows 98 or higher.  Treat yourself to a roachs world as you seek to restore Roger to his human form, and discover his hidden past."},

I let them dry, sprayed them with sealer and VIOLE!  Tic Tac Toe  one my 5 year old grandsons favorite games.  The bag then stores the rock game pieces.  Each bag has a drawstring style pull tie.  I loosely cross them to keep the bags closed.  The boys are very proud of their projects.  The spare purchased rocks will be painted and added to my rock garden that now has a mixture of agates, jasper and other rocks I found interesting in the past 40 years.    The bags are well sewn.. not terribly thick, but cotton.  So they could be washed delicately I believe, and then I would lay them flat to dry because they are cotton.

  {"id": 372, "content": "Wonderful View of Impact of Eugenics on Women in 20th Century | The Foundling a thoughtful and original  piece of historical fiction, expands on  a snippet of information from Ann Learys family about a time in the late 1920s when my home state, Pennsylvania, supported Laurelton Village for Feeble Minded women of Childbearing Age.  Her grandmother worked there for awhile, right when a US Census placed her there as an employee.  The long since debunked, but popular theory of eugenics, relied on to justify wiping out whole classes of people by Adolf Hitler in Germany, held that society could benefit from selective breeding to promote desirable characteristics and from ensuring those with problematic characteristics did not procreate.  In Germany, that meant Jews, Roma, gay people, Catholics, people with deformities and more.  In the early twentieth century in Pennsylvania, this meant that women who, e.g., were considered intellectually or morally defective, based on IQ tests for some and behavior for others.  Women and girls could wind up in such a place for being prostitutes, having children out of wedlock or based on a husbands or parents word that they were behaving in a manner that met the definition of feeble minded.  And, at least in the fictional Nettleton State Village for Feeble Minded Women of Childbearing Age, such women were admitted and could never leave until they were unable to bear children.  Dr. Agnes Vogel, a psychiatrist and rare female doctor at the time, runs the Village.  She speaks widely on its mission, ensures that as a working farm and a purveyor of servants to local residents the Village is selfsufficient and she fiercely protects the reputation and acceptability of the Village.  Mary Engle, who lived in an orphanage until age twelve after her mother died, then spent the rest of her youth living with her aunt in Scranton. She has experienced a lot of childhood trauma from experiences with family when outside the orphanage, but generally recalls her time at the orphanage as positive.  At 17, she has graduated from secretarial school.  Her mentor at the school introduces her to Dr. Vogel and soon, she finds herself working an office job at the Village.  When she spots a childhood friend from the orphanage working in the Dairy Barn at the Village, Mary is puzzled. Lillian is an inmate and Mary is surprised  Lillian is feeble minded.  Vogels speeches and discussions of her charges have fully won Mary over.  Through the course of the novel, we learn about the experiences of those living on the Village property as employees, as inmates and the slippage between high minded morality about the mission of the Village  and blatant disregard for even the recognized rights of the many women confined there, e.g. to food, shelter and personal security. We see the outside world evolving on the issue of eugenics, via a muckraker journalist friend to Mary.  We recognize, as we often must, that those we trust in powerful positions may use them for ill while others, including people with power, can change, grow and find the right path forward.  Leary is a compelling writer and she creates an engaging story full of interesting characters, giving them challenges to meet or not.  This was definitely a couldnt put it down book.  Will check out Learys other work."},

We go through a lot of micro USB cables. Over the years, I have learned that not all USB cables are created equally! First of all, the plastic the covers the ends of the cables is a solid material. We have had several cables that with use, bend or break in the place where the actual cable meets. Since this is all one piece on the ends, thats not going to happen. The cable is a good length. Its long enough that if its plugged in a lower outlet, it can still reach the end table, but its not too long that you have a lot of excess cable getting in the way. I love that its available in a few different colors. I selected the lime green one so its very easy to see which cable is mine! And if anyone walks away with it, I know which child has it! At first I had this in my car with a car charger. But over the last week, I never was in my car for more than 10 minutes at a time, so I couldnt get an accurate feel for whether or not it was a fast syncing cable. This morning I brought it inside and plugged into one of our charging stations. My phone was at 50 so I was curious to learn how quickly it would charge using this cable. Within 10 minutes my phone had charged  an additional 10. When I checked thirty minutes later, it was fully charged. I was quite pleased with that. I have a Nexus 5 phone and depending on where I am charging it, it often takes longer than that.  I received the Haweel Micro USB cable for the purpose of trying it out  reviewing it. My thoughts  opinions are my own."},

It is a stand alone book, but since I havent read any of the others, I felt a little lost and overwhelmed with all of the characters  the Kowalskis are a big family! The story started off slowly, but it does pick up somewhere around the middle. The main characters were described well, but some of the others who were probably introduced in the other titles, were not described enough for me which led to my confusion with them. I liked the main characters well enough, but I did feel that Liz was a little weak sometimes. The plot is a familiar one  boy falls in love with best friends little sister,  but best friend would not approve, so the two sneak around and try to fight the feelings that they have.Theres humor, romance, campingoutdoors, and a little bit of heat.

The leather can be used to attached it to the side of the cage if you want it more stable. I will be on the lookout for any problems after hearing that though. As with any of the things they sell for pets you have to be vigilant and check them out. So much could happen if a bird starts to pull and take apart all the hanging toys they sell nowadays.

I also had made some meatballs and sausage cooked in a frying pan and used this slow cooker at a Warm setting for about 2 hours. The meat stayed juicy and heated but not overcooked.

  {"id": 438, "content": "OK but needs some improvement. | I ordered this in the navy blue, mostly because I really liked the contrast of the white buttons that it has in the photos. Well it came with matching buttons.  For the pros It does fit well and pretty accurately. Im 510 and a 1618 in clothing right now, ordered this in an XL. It buttoned up fine and technically it does fit. The fabric is ok. It could stand to be a little thicker, but its not so thin that it will cause issues with sheerness. If needed, you can always just put on a light slip for the bottom.  Cons Im not sure how Im going to make the bust area of this dress work. But its really cute so Im going to keep it and try. Im a 38C and not very large at all. I have a broad chest but not particularly full. The point that Im getting at is that I dont necessarily have a ton to cover, but there just needs to be a bit more fabric in the cups. Anyway that I tie it, I either get boob coming out the bottom near where it ties or out the top. I just wasnt expecting it to be quite so revealing. Im going to work with it though and see if I can find a sticky bra that works or something like that. Also, if you arent naturally pretty perky, its going to be a challenge to find a bra option that will get you sitting high enough for the chest to look flattering. There is no real support in the fabric. I think a big improvement would be to add some type of sewn in cups to the top, that would really help."},

I weighed them with my luggage hook and it said 9 pounds, just as advertised. Lots of neat features. The wheels are protected by little edges and reinforced corners, so they may last a bit longer when battered by the baggage handlers. There is a extender zip, but honestly they are so huge inside I cant imagine using it.  As I was unpacking them I discovered there is a handle on the bottom where the wheels are! What a brilliant idea.  This means you can grab this suitcase just about any way it lands. SUPER handy when youre chasing your bag around the carousel because it landed wheel side toward you. There was a bit of chemical smell when I opened them, but I just aired them out and it is greatly reduced. I might lightly mist them with some Febreeze. But only if the smell lingers. The zippers are very heavy duty and the main zips do have the lock loop.  Inside there is a flat, top zip area and two adjustable straps on the bottom main compartment with a small side, mesh zip bag that is attached. Pretty standard confirguration inside. There is a limited warranty for manufacturer defect only and NO airline or consumer abuse andor normal wear issues. I did purchase the basic black because they were cheaper, but heres a tip  I use permanent sharpie pens gold, silver and copper  sold on Amazon for about 5.99 a set of three and a stencil also on Amazon and themes to fit everyone out there... at about 7.00 a sheet to personalize my suitcases so they are quick and easy to spot on the baggage carousel.. even at a distance. Because they are uniquely decorated, no one ever confuses my bag for theirs. WinWin. Tag inside one bag said Designed in the USA, made in China  Thought about docking one star for that part.... I travel a lot and will update if there are any wear or other issues. UPDATE 6152014  The chemical smell is a bit more than Id like... doing the Febreeze and I think a day out in the sun.  Some might consider a new car type smell, however, I am sensitive to chemical smells in general."},

The bowls Moms green cheeks could totally take a bath in any of the bowls  they are stainless steel  so that helps in cleaning, the top with the ladder  would work for a cockatiel but Moms green cheeks could NEVER use the ladder  her whole body is about 4 12.  So if you have a tiny parrot  know that the cage is meant for a much, much larger bird.  The drawers appear handy for cleaning.  The coating on the cage looks nice and seemed good.  It comes with the bowls 4 and a coiled string ladder and a couple of really garbage wooden perches they dont fit in the cage  too short!.  You can choose to have the feet on the cage or some really nice rolling feet  the rollers are quite nice.  It appears that it would stand up to steam cleaning which is how you can safely clean a bird cage without chemicals I really think it should be a 3 star  cage with my experience  zero stars when you consider it cant be used as a cage now  but the selling agents did compensate me so I was not left holding something that could not be returned its constructed and great effort and yet cant be used."},

The writers are really getting away from what this show was originally about and as others have stated all the makeup and hair styles are too much.

  {"id": 514, "content": "Durable AND beautiful | Im a dedicated amateur home baker who bakes several times a week, and there are two final frontiers still unknown to me yeast breads and fancy layer cakes. Unlike simple Bundt cakes or singlelayer cakes, layer cakes are composed of two usually three or more layers of carefully arranged cakes glued together with some sort of icing fudge, chocolate, buttercream, etc.. If youre trying to assemble and frost a layer cake on a stationary cake stand, its much harder to achieve a smooth finish when frosting the outside as you have to keep manually turning the stand, which can cause the cake to wobble and become crooked as youre trying to ice it.  I decided to take the plunge and invest in an Ateco revolving cake stand. It has a very solid cast iron base with a lovely vintage white finish and a 18 aluminum top. It also comes with a nonstick pad that can either be used under the stand to keep it anchored to the countertop, or on top of the stand to stabilize your layer cake.  There are several different companies Magic Line, Wilton, Ateco that manufacture similar cast iron revolving cake stands, but I chose Ateco based on prior brand purchases cake decorating equipment and the fact that the stand is constructed in the USA other than Nordicware, Libbey and Anchor, its increasingly difficult to find items made incountry!. It came highly recommended by Americas Test Kitchen as well. The packaging was very secure and I received my stand without any scratches or dents.  This is a hefty stand, both in weight and cost, that will stand up to a lifetime of use and is well worth the investment if youre a professional baker, pastry chef, or a home cook who makes a lot of layer cakes. If youre just a casual layer cake baker, consider Atecos USmade plastic revolving stand for 23 less. But this is the rare piece of kitchen equipment that is not only useful, but aesthetically pleasing as well I leave mine displayed on my bakers rack when not in use.  If youre looking for starter ideas for layer cakes, some of my favorites are ASIN1580085628 The Pastry Queen Royally Good Recipes from the Texas Hill Countrys Rather Sweet Bakery  Cafe by Rebecca Rather Texasinspired layer cakes and baked goods, ASIN1584797215 Baked New Frontiers in BakingASIN0609604538 Kaffeehaus Exquisite Desserts from the Classic Cafs of Vienna, Budapest, and Prague Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito, and Kaffeehaus Rick Rodgers."},

Then the morning after Halloween, it was completely on the ground. It was still intact, but on the grass. I think the biggest issue is the plastic pole. What little wind we did have wasnt enough to get the ghoul into a flying position, but it was enough to warp or bend the pole! A metal pole would have stayed up better.

She is struggling with her grief from her lawyer husbands sudden death.  She finds herself being less and less involved with the day to day life of the bookstore that she usually micromanages. It doesnt feel fun anymore.. In the course of this, some of her employees are becoming overwhelmed, others are less engaged than they once were and Sophie starts thinking about ways to be part of the store while physically escaping its hubbub in a most unconventional way.  Meanwhile, the developer who bought the parking lot out back seems to want to buy the store and tows peoples cars if they stay in the lot more than two hours..  Should she sell?  Bookish people is certainly centered on Mrs. Bernstein, but it includes an ensemble cast of store employees and her just graduated from college son.  Clemi is in charge of organizing and putting on all of the stores events, such as author readings.  Her mailbox is always full.  And why she has booked a poet who has gone viral in a bad way is beyond everyone but Clemi.  Noah is a slightly irresponsible but highly attractive store employee who gets away with everything.  Except for her letting that happen, Autumn T. is a decent store manager, taking over from long time manager Jamal who is moving away with his husband and child to start law school.  Mrs. Bernstein is devastated to have him leave.  Shes not sure how her employees see her, but Jamal has felt like a son to her in many ways.  Then, theres Florence, who was fired for something youll have to find out for yourself and banned from the store, but she is very much in Clemis life.  They were roommates, but theyve had to rent out Florences room and shes now sharing Clemis room.  Not good. There eventually is a tortoise as well, but staff may not bring pets to the store so how did that happen?  Despite some competitiveness, the staff is close and they socialize outside of work.  Mrs. Bernstein is invited to their parties the lunar eclipse watching party from one persons roof and the come as your favorite superhero party scheduled for the following night.  She assumes they dont really want her to come and she is pretty clearly into isolating, not socializing. Bookish people truly brings us into the day to day experience of owning, staffing, experiencing the day to day life of an independent bookstore.  It is also full of laugh out loud humor, I wont spoil it by describing this, but the humor, flawlessly woven in, earns this already engaging book five stars from me for pure, consistent entertainment and time well spent.

There is an adjustable grind dial on the top.  Comes with a brush for cleaning and charging cords that are quite short. You can use any regular USB cord you have and I did for the initial charge. The base is clear glass.  There is a rubber or like nub that you press on and it will grind until you stop it.  No more twisting your wrist while you try to hold onto the grinder.  As I have gotten older, its less comfortable.  Now, I have just begun using these and I hope that they will retain a charge for a reasonable time.  Also, I did have to put a plug extender on my kitchen counter that also included USB ports.  I didnt want to have to take them to my bedroom to charge when they needed it.  They are fairly heavy  partly because of the glass bottoms.  They recommend not filling more than 80 to make sure they grind properly.  I followed that advice.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. UPDATE  2202021... Just a quick note.  I have found that when you turn over the grinders, they start.  Initially they did not.  Why, I am not sure.  But when you tip them they grind and continue to grind until you right them...  Most of the time anyway.  There is a button to press onoff.  Which is good because they dont always grind when turned.  Hmmm.  One less star for the reliability not really being 5 star.  But I still consider it at least a 4."},

Ordered for our newly licensed driver to keep in trunk of his older but actually reliable used car. As one who lives at home and putters within a 50100 mile radius around town.. its basically an economical kit for one with a fail safe or plan b. If any difficulties occurred where the kit fell short mine could easily get help by calling momdad!  Everything pictured online is included and should perform task at hand. But, reason I suggest kit for lighter circumstances.. is simply bc of the overall quality of items included this isnt top tier!! ie, tow strap it has one but expect it FAR less substantial in person than shown on line.. expect ability to tow smaller vehicle on flatsmooth surface vs. tow SUV up hill or out of snow bank. Shovel has mid handle connector that may bend under heavy load at weak point plus, spade is tiny!.. Jumper cables have tiny jaws  cord is thin. careful to rollstore without creasing so no wire damage. Firstaid is handy if needing bandaid but, wont save any lives. Tool kit items struggle to clip into place inside their case. I do appreciate batteries included in flashlight, a smaller zip pouch for first aid kit, integrity of solid zipper on outside of bag can opener on shovel edge.  For 30 it is a basic version of most common items pulled into a kit you may rarely need x1 you hate spending  on but have in case.. Kit is best for those who have a Plan B just a call away! Its not ideal for peep in remote areas, traveling across country or unreliable vehicle.. Works for extra car, teen driver etc. One can always use as a starting point and beef it up as time goes on I do love bag it comes with.. holds everything safe in one place. seatbeltglass release should be kept in front of vehicle not stored inside pack in trunk!

  {"id": 593, "content": "Delicious Mediterranean meze and baked goods, but needs some minor edits | Several years ago, a fellow cookbook collector gifted me a copy of Ana Sortuns excellent ASIN0060792280 Spice Flavors of the Eastern Mediterranean, and I fell instantly and madly in love. Sortun is the executive chef behind Oleana and Sofra. Classically trained at La Varenne, she decided to incorporate Mediterranean spices and the mezze mentality after studying in Turkey. Sofra Cafe and Bakery opened in 2008 and serves mezze and baked goods from Turkey, Lebanon, and Greece, all of which are amply represented in quotSoframiz.quot  Ive long admired Turkish cuisine and have collected numerous books on the subject including recent releases ASIN1743368577 Istanbul Cult Recipes, ASIN1849496633 Eat Istanbul A Journey to the Heart of Turkish Cuisine, and ASIN1743360495 Anatolia Adventures in Turkish Cooking, so when I heard that Ana and Maura Kilpatrick were coming out with a Sofra cookbook, I was ecstatic. Ive had the galley for several months, and have made numerous recipes from the book, including the spicy tomato bulgur salad, stuffed simit, Persian carrot and black eyed pea salad, and tahini shortbread cookies.  The recipes include breakfast, meze, flatbreads, savory pies, cookies and confections, specialty pastries, cakes and desserts, and beverages. If youve never experienced a Turkish or Israeli breakfast, youre in for a treat traditional breakfast spreads include many small bowls and plates of olives, tahini, stuffed flatbreads, egg dishes, vegetables and cheeses taking up the entire table. Breakfast at Sofra includes such staples as Shakshuka baked eggs with spicy tomato sauce, rolled omelet with zaatar and labne, flower pogaca rolls, date orange brioche tart, pistachio toaster pastries with rosewater glaze, and morning buns iwth orange blossom glaze.  The meze really shine and make for inspired snacking or afternoon pickmeups, from the whipped cheese spreads and hummus to hearty and healthy beanbased salads Persian carrot and blackeyed peas, Egyptianstyle pea salad with walnuts, barley and chickpea salad, yellow split peas with zaatar spiced almonds. I made several for this review and all were definite repeats.  My true passion is baking, so the breads and baked goods were the real test. My first disappointment was that measurements are only given in volume, not weight as a serious home baker, I much prefer the precision of weighing my flours, particularly as I live in an extremely humid climate which affects the weight of flour. I also had some issues with several of the bread recipes I tried the stuffed simit featured on the cover calls for 1 cup water to 2 14 cups of flour, and what initially greeted me was almost like pancake batter. I continued to add flour by the tablespoon, as well as a little olive oil, and eventually had a very soft but workable dough that was wonderfully moist. The Turkish method of brushing with pekmez grape molasses lends a sweet finish to the savory filling of feta and zaatar spiced almonds and the toasted sesame seed topping. The bread is delicious on its own or as an accompaniment to the salads in the book.  Fans of Middle Eastern pastries will be in heaven from pistachio birds nests a recipe I have not encountered in my many other Turkish books to Persian love cake, kunefe, umm Ali with caramelized apples, chocolate hazelnut baklava, brown butter pecan pie with espresso dates, date espresso maamoul, and milky walnutfig baklava, this is a bakers paradise.  I encountered an issue with the tahini shortbread cookies, which calls for 2 tsp salt I crosschecked the recipe on the internet, and the online version I found also called for 2 tsp. salt. My bakers instinct told me to start with much less I went with 12 tsp salt, which is what most of the other cookie and shortbread recipes in quotSoframizquot called for, and Im certainly glad I didnt use the full amount as they would have been too salty for my taste. Also, I followed the recipe to the letter, and ended up with more like 3 or 4 dozen cookies. The recipe calls for 12 cup toasted sesame seeds but you are only instructed to use 14 cup. The resulting cookies were absolutely delicious and would be fantastic as part of a cheese tray as the sesame lends a savory edge.  Gorgeous matte photography and clear, large font make this a pleasure to read and cook from I prefer matte pages as it means no glare in my cookbook holder. I loved the recipes I tried, but found in several instances that there are small errors, so be sure to read through the entire recipe in advance and make note if an ingredient is mentioned that is not in the list, or an amount seems off.  Overall quotSoframizquot is one of my top cookbook picks for 2016 Ill be releasing my 2016 cookbook roundup in the next month or two, and one that fans of Turkish, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine will certainly want to add to their collections."},

  {"id": 608, "content": "An enjoyable romp true to Dame Agathas Poirot | Murder on the Orient Express is the second Agatha Christie novel to be made into a PC game by AWE Productions, with several notable improvements from their first AC outing And Then There Were None Ten Little Indians. The story centers on a murder aboard the famous Orient Express. Set in 1934 when the novel was originally published, twelve passengers including Belgian detective Hercule Poirot are trapped in the snowbound train during a winter avalanche. When one of the passengers is murdered, all are suspect. Instead of playing as Poirot, a new character, Antoinette Marceau, was invented, combining two characters from the original novel a French lieutenant and M. Bouc, director of the rail company. Antoinette does Poirots sleuthing for him after he is injured, and does so with grace and wit.  The book deviates from the novels original ending, adding a new dimension to the mix. The majority of the ingame dialogue is taken directly from the novel, and new dialogue fits in well with Dame Agathas original spirit. Graphics are excellent characters are appropriately dressed and styled for the mid1930s, and the background details are exquisite. The ingame camera lends itself to very cinematic moments, including exterior shots of the train as Antoinette briefs Poirot. Although not perfect, I greatly enjoyed Murder on the Orient Expressn and am greatly impressed at how much thought and care was taken to make the game true to the book.  The good  Graphics  Music  Plot including new ending  Inclusion of paperback copy of Murder on the Orient Express  Rating system you earn more points for deducing solutions without Poirots assistance  Ability to jump between rail cars to cut down on backtracking  Superb voice acting, particularly from David Suchet, the original BBC Poirot  The bad  One or two extremely farfetched puzzles that required a walkthrough youll never look at cake batter and orange juice the same way!  Certain features are not intuitive  userfriendly. The most serious of these are the inventory and fingerprinting functions.  If youve already read the book  seen the movie, you know how this ends.  If Antoinette is French educated in England, why is her spoken French so horribly British???  Note a patch is available that corrects several minor gameplay issues related to dialogue, inventory, and crashes."},

  {"id": 615, "content": "Enjoyable historical fiction 1880s NYC early nursing and early thieving | The Nurses Secret promised to be and mostly was a perfect book of its kind.  The sort that, if it were a series, Id busily look for the next installment.  Una, a woman in her early twenties, is a pickpocket in Manhattan in 1883 New York.  Her Fagin is Marm Blei, a woman who took Una into her fold when she found her doing a poor job of stealing an apple.  Unas father is a drunk and later an opium addict.  Her mother died in a fire when she was nine.  Until then, Una lived a solidly middle class life, but without her mother, they lost everything and she eventually landed on the streets at 9.  We first meet Una as an adult, when she is sizing up marks at the arrival piers.  Skenandore does a wonderful job giving us the feel of that scene, of the city in 1883, of the way Una lives at this time and the cunning she has developed to avoid being caught.  She has a subsistence life in a tiny bleak apartment with three roommates, fellow thieves but not really friends.  Because she gets mixed up in a situation that results in her being suspected of murder, Una has to find a way to hide.  She discovers Bellevue hospital has started a nurse training program, so with forged papers and her con artist tongue she is accepted and.. it turns out shes good at this stuff.  The training for nurses and the controversies in medicine of the era e.g. the need to clean up before performing surgery are woven through this part of the novel, with Una, just, maintaining her cover. Despite her plan to just hide in plain site till the fuss about the murder blows over and to get nursing jobs in wealthy homes where she can steal more valuable stuff, things start to change for Una.  Not in a dramatic way and always consistent with who she is.  She tentatively moves toward developing what may be her first real friendships with a few people and things go well until she goes through a devastating situation with a patient who she recognizes from her past.  This leads to a series of decisions that relate the the murder she was accused of, as she continues to hide her past and try to keep up her training.  All in all, the story of an imposter who can almost fake being proper but who is decidedly a misfit makes for a great story.  The historical setting and information on early professional nursing is fabulous and beautifully told. Unas pluck and shifts in her world view as she sees other opportunities is believable and, since she is always likable, we root for her.  My only gripe is that the ending, which I must not spoil, came together in a way that felt jarring and less consistent with the novel.  Thinking it over, it may have been necessary to reach the conclusion it reached but too much happened too fast in ways that seemed inconsistent with how things were developing and then, as any historical fictioncozyabout a 19th century pick pocket must, everything resolved.  Im not even taking a star away for that because this was truly an enjoyable book.  I just want to sort out and rewrite the end to make it flow for me.  And yet I get why it had to go the way it did."},

  {"id": 639, "content": "Not Really Much About the Civil Rights Movement | This book caught my interest because of the Ruby Bridges John Steinbeck connection. I was disappointed because it turned out to be more a story of a 13 yearolds life in 1960s Louisiana. The 34Cheerleaders34 and Ruby were like a secondhand storyline. The plot was much more involved with the details of the interaction between the mother, Louise the teenage daughter, and the way male companions treated them both. There was a memorable moment where the mother is asked why she has a problem with Ruby and Louise attending school together, since they are both really just two little girls. Giving nicknames to the 34Cheerleaders34, like 34Coffin34 and 34Poison34 was an effective technique it showed how evil these women behaved those  day at the school. Some of the language used commonly during the 60s was still disturbing and makes this book one for young adults, not younger readers. There are also some scenes of domestic abuse. If I were to read this again, I would skip to the scenes about Ruby Bridges. and to the end. Spoiler alert the mom seems to be having a change of heart as she watches Ruby enter the school. I had to wonder if she was perhaps picturing Louise in that traumatic situation?"},

  {"id": 645, "content": "A beautiful compilation of Thai cooking and culture | JeanPierre Gabriel spent three years traveling through every region of Thailand visiting homes, markets and restaurants, sampling dishes from every corner and collecting recipes along the way. The result is a collection of 500 easytofollow recipes and 200 breathtaking images of Thailands landscape, people, and food. The scope of the book is truly impressive hundreds of Thai cooks contributed recipes youll find the list of contributors in the back and all regions of Thailand are represented. Most Thai cookbooks marketed to American audiences seem to focus on  wellknown dishes like pad Thai that are on American Thai restaurant menus here youll find insectbased dishes from Thailands Northeast Issan, where ingredients such as bamboo caterpillars, house crickets, and giant water bugs are foraged, pork dishes from Northern Thailand including many sausagebased dishes, desserts from Central Thailand, seafood from Eastern Thailand, and Indianinfluenced  Muslim dishes from Southern Thailand.  The book begins with a series of essays that explore the history of Thailands regions and cuisine and includes chapters on snacks and drinks, salads and soups, curries, stir fries, rice and noodles, grilled and fried dishes, desserts and more. Each recipe includes the dishs name in Thai no English transliteration, the region, preparation time and cooking time. Measurements are given in  imperial, weight, and metric, with British terms in parentheses where applicable. There are generally two recipes to a page four to a spread. Throughout the chapters, gorgeous matte photos of Thai landscapes, markets, ingredients and people give a comprehensive view at the diversity and natural abundance of Thailand. Staged photos of raw ingredients are like miniature artworks.  Thai cuisine is based on several principles, the most important being the four fundamental taste areas spicy, sweet, sour, and salty. Two of the fundamental cooking methods, steaming and stir frying in a wok, are inherited from the Chinese. A nonstick wok is bet for stirfrying rice or noodle dishes, while stainless steel or castiron woks are more suitable for stirfrying fish, meat or vegetables. I was fascinated to learn of the history of various fried rice dishes the few times Id seen them on the menu in Thai restaurants, I assumed it was an attempt to cater to Chinese food enthusiasts, but fried rice a long history in Thailand, and youll find many complex and delicious variations here seafood fried rice shrimp paste fried rice with sweet pork, crab fried rice, Thai pork fried rice with fried eggs, fried rice with pineapple, etc. I also loved the noodle dishes like fried noodles in coconut milk with shrimp, which has a tart element from tamarind sauce, sweetness from coconut milk and palm sugar, and heat from chilies.  There is an extensive collection of curry dishes, which introduced me to a whole new range of Thai cooking including fish curry in banana leaf luckily our Central Market always carries fresh banana leaves, roasted duck curry, coconut milk curries, and mango curry. Seafood is also amply represented, with many seafood curries along with grilled, fried, and stirfried fish and crab dishes.  I have an infamous sweet tooth, and the only Thai dessert I was familiar with before Thailand The Cookbook was sticky rice and mangoes, but I was fascinated to learn of the candied fruits and vegetables that reminded me of Mexico pumpkin in syrup, sweet potato in ginger syrup, candied sugar palm fruit, steamed puddings, and beanbased desserts mung bean porridge with coconut milk, colorful mung bean noodles in coconut milk, mung bean puddings and custards. Not surprisingly, fruit plays a starring role, particularly bananas and coconut.  The final chapter is a list of guest chefs from Thai restaurants in Sydney Sailors Thai, Chat Thai, New York Kin Shop, Uncle Boons, London Rosas Thai Caf, and Bangkok Bo.lan, Kiin Kiin and their selected recipes.  The most challenging aspect will be finding the fresh and staple ingredients called for in many of the regional recipes pandan leaves, sugar palm fruits, durian, tiger grass leaves, pork floss, dried buffalo skin, some seafood, frog, and fresh insects crickets, ants, ant eggs, giant water bug eggs. There is no list of suggested online or local Thai markets, and no substitutions suggested in the ingredients although you will find suggested substitutions in the glossary for select ingredients. For this reason, I will not be able to make many of the more authentic recipes, but there are still plenty that I can try with my limited range of Thai ingredients that I can purchase locally lemongrass, Thai chilies, tamarind, kaffir lime leaves, banana leaves, fish sauce.  Overall, Thailand The Cookbook is a labor of love and a beautiful travelogue that will introduce you or take you back to Thailands rich cultural and culinary diversity. The staggering number of recipes is sure to feature something for everyone and provides plenty of variety to keep you experimenting happily for many months if not years to come. The book itself is gorgeous, starting with the goldembossed fabric cover and extending through the books design, including intricate geometric designs that mark each particular chapter in the Table of Contents. Whether you are already familiar with  Thai cuisine or are looking for an approachable introduction, Thailand The Cookbook deserves a place on your cookbook shelf.  Review copy courtesy of Phaidon"},

So I picked out Oneida Dover, it goes really nicely with my Mikasa Remembrance fine china. I ordered the 45 piece set it comes with some serving pieces. As you will see in the photos, there were problems. Salad Forks, Dinner Forks, Knifes, Diner Spoons and teaspoons all had missing or smuggled flowers on the handles. I called Oneida customer service. They said they are not aware of the problems. I sent them the photos and they checked there stock and found the same problems. They told me to call Amazon and return the silverware. This set was made in Indonesia. I am hoping in a few months the problem will be fix. If you look at Macys the reviews are the same thing. Since November 2022 there is this problem.  Oneida was sold to Lenox and Lenox was sold to someone else. The Moldingstamping has gone down hill."},
  {"id": 661, "content": "Nice table.... with the drawer | This will be a long but helpful review, I hope. I think this is a nice heavy table. It was so easy to put together following the easy directions which are just pictures with the part numbers on it and that was great !...until I got to the drawer!! Lol. I carefully looked at the directions before I put it together, or so I thought. Then I saw those little white hole plugs and have never used them before. I thought they would be put in after the screws to coverplug where the screw was showing...wrong, they need to be put in BEFORE the screws go in..and you have to make sure the little holes in them match up with where the screws so the screws can go into them. They keep the screws nice and tight in their holes. I didnt know that as like I said, have never used this type before. So I had to take one of the sides off since that is all I did at this point, so I could do it correctly and move on to finishing the drawer. Lesson 1 learned. The rest of the drawer went together so nice and easy...or so I thought...until I had to put the drawer into the table !! Lol Here I sit in my kitchen trying to slide it into the rollers..after a few shoves and angry words, I gave up and looked for the if you need help, call...number there is NONE on the instruction sheet !! Ugh. So I carefully studied the drawing of the drawer bit by bit as I compared my drawer to the drawing..alas I have noticed that on the drawer the slide has an open end and a closed end..on step 7, it sure would have been helpful to put a circle around that part or notation saying  make sure  the opened end of the slide is facing the front of the drawer naturally mine were facing the back... or mention there is a left and a right on the side parts, so I had to take the whole thing apart ..again. Then I put the drawer in front of the table and it slid right in !!!!  I was going to use the table without the drawer if it didnt go in this time lol. But all in all this is a wonderful, nice table that was very easy to assemble..that drawer mmm not so much lol. Lesson 2 learned, look extremely careful at the drawings. But I am hoping the drawer will be much easier for you to put together after reading this. Very happy with this table."},

She had one of her friends come over this past weekend who shares the passion for dinosaurs. They had fun exploring what this kit had to offer. The first thing they did was dig for dinosaurs. She had a similar kit that she had already done, so she used the extra tools from it so they could both actively participate in this. It took longer than they expected, but they had fun finding the bones. The bones are cheaply made and unfortunately they damaged some of the pieces during the excavation. That activity also made quite a mess! Lots of gypsum dust!! They split the remaining activities. One of them assembled the dino skeleton and then painted it, while the other one painted the dinosaur model. The kits were pretty similar to other paint and model kits. It took them nearly two hours to complete everything. This is definitely a one time use activity, but thats not a bad thing. I like to think of it as an experience. I would consider giving this kit or a similar one to one of my nieces or nephews."},

They officers from the Denver Police Departments Community Response Unit, assigned to take over a murder investigation in Blackwater Falls, Colorado. This is the first time they have worked closely together. The CSU is assigned to take this case over from Sheriff Grant, who has been the subject of ongoing complaints of harassment against the local refugee community.  Among other things, we quickly learn that he minimized and ignored reports that several teenaged girls from that community, two dark skinned Somali girls and one light skinned Syrian girl, all Muslim have gone missing, suggesting they ran away from repressive parents.  Except, now Razan, the Syrian girl, has been found, nailed, as if she were crucified, to the door of a local Mosque, wearing clothing intended to make her look like an artists version of the Virgin Mary. Who killed her and why?  Razans father worked at the local meat cutting plant, where he was injured and let go without compensation. Is there a connection? Razan received and served out a prestigious internship at a government contractor firm that is engaged in top secret work. Some people resented that the internship did not go to a popular white boy. A local Evangelical church whose preacher rails against the ungodliness of Muslims and the areas immigrantrefugee population draws attention, in particular since some of its members make up a social motorcycle club, the Disciples, who can be menacing at a minimum.  There are more potential suspects, but in putting together the Blackwater Falls Community, Khan created both built in conflict and suspicion that reflects some broader perspectives in the US about police, about Muslims, about antiimmigration zealots, about women and about certain types of religious congregations with strong social and political views. Khan avoids stereotyping, highlighting nuances among members of all of these groups, creating individuals with varied backstories, ethnicities, cultures and perspectives. She does this seemingly effortlessly, managing to explaindemonstrate the ridiculousness and danger of stereotyping in the course of her writing.  Blackwater Falls gives us sweet and humorous glimpses of Rahmans family life. Her father is a criminal defense lawyer. Her mother is a homemaker, eager to marry off her eldest daughter. One is Afghan, one Pakistani. Seif, too, is obviously from a Muslim background, but he resists Iyanas comments that might lead to a discussion of his origins. We learn at some point that his parents are dead and that one was Palestinian and one Iranian. There are hints of attraction between Seif, who is not observant and Inaya who is very observant,  but more often, we see the conflicts in their approach to their work and their colleagues. There are some terrific female friendships and parentchild relationships and lots of appealing characters.  The mystery is well plotted and Khan is a wonderful writer, never clumsy and always interesting, This was a highly entertaining read and I look forward to the rest of the series."},

However, we realize that we do not use a great deal of the phones capability in fact, we probably use only about 1 of what we could use.  In addition, the iPhone 6 does not come with a written users manual, and I wish it did.  We ordered both iPhone 6s Portable Genius and the Teach Yourself Visually manual for the iPhone 6.  While I have to give a slight edge to the Teach Yourself Visually book, the Portable Genius is excellent, too.  It does not have as many colored screen shots, but it does have detailed illustrations and step by step directions for any operation you can imagine.  Actually, the two manuals complement each other nicely.  The Portable Genius has more text, so if that suits your learning style, go with this book.  Some of the areas covered in this manual include an overview of the audio features of the phone and an extensive chapter on the camera and all its features.  By the way, if you have not yet purchased an iPhone, you will be blown away by the potential of the camera.  It is, by far, the best camera I have ever owned,  You will also learn about the Cloud, and I freely confess that I did not really understand the Cloud until I read this book. The chapter on fixing your iPhone is invaluable.  Truly, I am glad we have both books.  I give the Portable Genius my highest recommendation."},

Also, there were a lot of emails that were just a few words or one sentence. Those felt more like texts than emails. The story was really difficult to get into. The pacing was a bit slow, but in the second half of the book, it does pick up some speed. I also felt like I didnt get to really know the characters at all.

I was very excited to be given an advance copy of her latest book in exchange for my honest  unbiased review.  This book is totally different from The Wisdom of Hair. Its about a 49 year old woman named Billie for starters. Im 48 and usually lead characters end up being much younger than me, so I liked that. Billie has a teenage daughter  I also have a teenage daughter. But fortunately for me, thats where the similarities end. Billie is a single mom and her older teen daughter has a toddler. The book started a little slowly for me. Theres the introduction of a lot of characters and some back story to wade through, but if you stick with it, youll be pleased. It definitely picks up. Billie befriends an elderly woman, Miss Sadie, who is trying to make things right before she dies. Poor Sadie was a woman whose abusive husband made her sell her babies through private adoptions. Billie agrees to help Sadie track down her long lost children and that sets a chain of events that leads to some very dramatic and exciting chapters. It definitely became a book that I had difficulties putting down as it progressed. I did get confused a little at times because of all the different characters. I had to go back a few times to recall who a couple of the minor characters were. I found it to be unpredictable and I enjoyed reading this book and I look forward to her next title.

There are two covers at the bottom of the case for the USB cord and headphones. When you put the case on, OPEN those covers first and the phone will pop right into the case.

Youll find all your Chinese favorites like Beef and Broccoli, General Tsos Chicken, Lemon Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Lo Mein along with Galbi Koreanstyle short ribs, Thai curries, Bahn mi, tom yum, pho, fried rice, noodle dishes, sides and desserts.  Most of these qualify as onepot dishes despite the title, not all involve the slow cooker, making prep and cleanup easy. Ingredients are listed in both US and metric equivalents, and most ingredients should be readily available at your grocery store. Each recipe has a gorgeous fullcolor photo as well. The sauces in particular are standouts, even more so considering that relatively few ingredients are used so no trips to the ChineseOriental supermarket trying to track down hardtofind sauces and pastes.  As a vegetarian, I loved the Asianinspired soups like the Thai pumpkin curry soup, miso soup with vegetables and soba noodles, and Chinese hot and sour soup. There is a whole chapter devoted to meatless mains, including a vegetarian mapodofu, Thai red curry vegetables, Chinese eggplant with garlic sauce, General Tsos Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes, and Thai basil tofu and vegetable rice casserole.   THAI BUTTERNUT SQUASH CURRY SOUP  YIELD 45 SERVINGS  5 cups 2250 g butternut squash or pumpkin, peeled and cubed 1 cup 200 g sweet potatoes, peeled, roughly cubed 1 medium onion, peeled, diced 1 tbsp 8 g fresh ginger, peeled 3 garlic cloves, sliced 3 cups 710 ml chicken or vegetable broth 1 13.5oz 400ml can coconut milk 1 tbsp 816 g red curry paste, to taste  tsp turmeric 1 tbsp 15 ml fresh lime juice Salt and pepper, to taste Drizzle of coconut milk, for garnish optional Pumpkin seeds, for garnish optional Chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish optional Sliced red chili pepper, for garnish optional  Place the squash, sweet potatoes, onion, ginger, garlic and broth in a 4 to 5quart 3.8 to 4.7L slow cooker. Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or on high for 3 to 4 hours, until the squash and sweet potatoes are soft and cooked through.  Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, red curry paste, turmeric and lime juice. Allow the soup to cool slightly before pureacuteeing. Using an immersion blender, pureacutee directly in the slow cooker or pour contents into a blender and pureacutee until smooth. Adjust seasonings as needed with salt and pepper.  Serve warm in bowls and garnish with a drizzle of coconut milk, pumpkin seeds, cilantro and sliced red chili pepper, if desired.  I love that so many of the ingredients are readily available nothing is more frustrating than finding a dish that looks great, but not being able to locate specialty ingredients especially true with some Chinese and Asian cookbooks.  The addition of desserts was a nice touch as I love to use my slow cooker for desserts I also highly recommend Michele Scicolones 34The Mediterranean Slow Cooker34 for its desserts chapter. Here youll find a mandarin orange cheesecake, Asian pear pudding cake, black sesame brownies, Chinese steamed sponge cake, ginger tea poached pears, Lunar New Year sweet rice cake, mango coconut tapioca pudding, matcha green tea cake, sweet green bean soup, and Thai coconut sticky rice with mango.  Here is Kellys recipe for Black Sesame Brownies the ground black sesame seeds lend an almost peanutbutterlike depth.   BLACK SESAME BROWNIES YIELD 10 SERVINGS 1 cup 125 g allpurpose flour  cup 30 g unsweetened cocoa powder 2 tsp 5 g black sesame powder or finely ground black sesame seeds  tsp baking powder  tsp salt  cup 58 g unsalted butter  cup 90 g semisweet chocolate chips 1 cup 225 g sugar 3 large eggs, lightly beaten 1 tsp pure vanilla extract  cup 90 g semisweet mini chocolate chips, plus more for topping, if desired  Take a long piece of aluminum foil and fold it lengthwise into a long strip. Press it along the inside perimeter of your slow cooker, creating a ring. This will prevent the edges from burning. Next, line the bottom with a piece of parchment, leaving an overhang on the sides for easier removal. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sesame powder, baking powder and salt.  Place the butter and chocolate chips in a medium microwavesafe bowl. Heat on high power for 30second increments, stirring well after each, until completely smooth and melted. Whisk in the sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs, one by one, then add the vanilla.  Slowly stir in the flour mixture until just combined do NOT overmix. Fold in the mini chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the lined slow cooker and smooth out using a rubber spatula. Top with additional chocolate chips if desired.  Cover the slow cooker with a double layer of paper towels then place the lid securely over the towels. This prevents any water from dripping into the cake batter.  Cook on low for 212 to 3 hours, then remove the cover and cook for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the insert from the slow cooker and allow to cool completely. Lift the parchment paper to remove the brownies and slice into squares.  Kelly has also provided a handy guide to browning, cuts of meat, layering, sizes and brands of slow cookers, and general tips. In addition, a section on the Asian pantry includes a brief overview of staples such as black bean sauce  paste, sambal oelek, coconut milk, doenjang, dried chilis, fish sauce, spices, and other seasonings that youll need to create the dishes in 34The Asian Slow Cooker.34  Verdict If you love Asian cuisine but think you dont have the time to create it at home, think again! 34The Asian Slow Cooker34 will have you throwing out your takeout menus in favor of easy homemade versions with far fewer additives, plus there is enough variety and range of Asian cuisines Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Korean to keep you happily cooking for months to come.

  {"id": 757, "content": "Strong Lead, Good Story | Read a couple of Peter Heltons Chris Honeysett books first and really enjoyed them, then I read Four Below featuring DI Liam McClusky.  The two characters are so different and the general tone of the books is too. The Honeysett books are light and fun and have quirky, arty characters who dabble at crime solving and muck about with unreliable cars and ever so slightly shady characters.  McClusky on the other hand is a professional investigator, but he is also wonderfully flawed, quirky but not arty, follows his insightful hunches doggedly to an excellent nail biting resolution.  I would summarize the Honeysett character books as great snacks and Four Below the only McClusky book I have read as a totally enjoyable full meal of a mystery story.  I love mysteries and think Heltons books was very well done.  Four Below would make a great movie and I cant wait to read more McClusky mysteries!"},

  {"id": 764, "content": "A treasured keepsake | I discovered An Ellis Island Christmas while trying to research my own familys journey from Poland in 1917. Growing up, I remember my babcia grandmother storing her sewing supplies in a small wicker hamper with a cloth lining. This was the same container that brought my grandmother and greatgrandmothers possessions from Zamosc, Poland. When I flipped through An Ellis Island Christmas and saw that beautiful watercolor of a Polish willow hamper that matched my own heirloom, it was an emotional moment.  The picture book tells the story of Krysia, a sixyearold Polish girl whose father has already left for America as was frequently the case. Now, Krysia and her mother and brothers are boarding a steamship that will take them to Ellis Island. Their journey is a tiring one, first having to walk on foot to reach their point of departure, then facing seasickness and storms at sea before arriving at their destination. Because this is a book aimed at ages 5 and up, there are brief hints of immigrants deported for illnesses and the threat of WWI, but the story does not dwell or linger on these darker moments, instead focusing on Krysias wonder at the journey, her friend and shipmate Zanya, and her dolls.  Christmas Eve at Ellis Island is a wondrous experience for Krysia, who discovers that Father Christmas has made the journey all the way from Poland. She also discovers bananas and electric lights for the first time.  The beautiful watercolor  colored pencil graphics truly bring Krysias experience to vibrant life the haunting image of the Statue of Liberty must have been exactly as my grandmother saw it when she was a little girl. The sepiatoned illustrations of a rustic Polish cottage and the imposing Ellis Island hallways are softened by the melancholy Krysia, until she smiles at last when being reunited with her papa.  This is a beautiful book to introduce younger readers to the Ellis Island immigrant experience, and its even more meaningful for those of us who had a grandparent who immigrated in recent memory . I was lucky enough to finally track down the original ship manifests and Ellis Island documents for my Polish grandparents who immigrated at roughly the same time as Krysia, and my personal experiences as a secondgeneration PolishAmerican made An Ellis Island Christmas even more meaningful."},

Set in Bascom, North Carolina, the novel revolves around the lives of Waverley sisters Sydney and Claire, who are descended from a long ling of Waverleys possessing magical abilities related to their unique garden.  Claire, the older sister, is very set in her ways and is awkward around others, so she throws herself into her catering business to avoid romance and socialization. Her younger sister Sydney has been on the run for ten years, in a life modeled after their flighty mother. The Waverleys have a reputation for being eccentric Claire embraces hers by using mysterious blends of herbs and flowers to influence diners moods. A pinch of anise hyssop eases frustration and confusion, while chicory gives a false sense of comfort, and the stimulant dandelion encourages faithfulness. Claire uses these various combinations to create meals that evoke a specific mood for a rich, powerful couples event, she cooks nutmegstuffed squash blossoms, fennel chicken, and rosepetal scones, since roses signify love, and cinnamon and nutmeg mean prosperity. But at that same event, Claire takes her revenge by modifying the dessert to include lemonbalm sorbet, dandelion petals, and mint leaves, creating regret.  Claires carefully orchestrated life is turned upside down when Sydney returns to Bascom with her young daughter Bay in tow. Like Claire, Bay seems to have special abilities, and forges a bond with the magical apple tree in the backyard. This tree is able to tell a person what the greatest or worst event in their life will be, and has human characteristics snatching things playfully, throwing apples.  However, when part of Sydneys past comes back to haunt her, its up to the Waverly sisters to put things right. The secondary characters are equally memorable Evanelle is a distant cousin, and her gift is the ability to give people small gifts that will be important in their lives in the future. Fred is the towns gay grocer whos in the middle of a devastating breakup with his partner of thirty years. And the rival Clarks Emma and Ariel are petty and sexobsessed, continuing an old feud with the Waverleys. All of these characters have important roles to play.  The novels pacing is perfect, the setting rich and evocative, and the descriptions of food are mouthwatering. It would have been nice to include several of the mentioned recipes as with Like Water for Chocolate they sounded intriguing. This was a delightful read that I couldnt put down, and I look forward to reading Allens next book ASIN0553805495 The Sugar Queen."},

I would highly recommend the book for anyone traveling to the Emerald Isle as an alternative to what I feel can sometimes be the complexity of Frommers. I have also obtained the Lonely Planet guide to Italy which I have not, as of yet, been able to use.

In her new novel The Mister, we first meet Maxim Trevelyan, an English earl with a newly inherited estate in Cornwall following his elder brothers unexpected death, whose first page of interior monologue is a narcissistic ode to mindless sex. Not exactly the best way to try to make the reader feel anything other than loathing for the main character and unfortunately he doesnt get much better.  At the beginning of the novel, Maxim, a 28yearold aristocratic playboy whose elder brother Kit has just died, is now obliged to step in and start fulfilling his role as heir to the Trevethick estate get used to that name as it is almost a regular occurrence on every page. He is irritated by his inheritance as that means giving up his nocturnal habits of playing house music at nightclubs in Hoxton a trendy part of east London for hipsters and creatives and using his good looks to sleep with in his words, hot, skinny women. But one morning his world is unexpectedly turned upsidedown even more when his regular maid is replaced by Alessia Demachi, whose entrance jolts Maxim into an uncharacteristic pattern of keeping his P in his pants. As it turns out Alessia not just a cleaner but an illegal immigrant from Albania that is trying to escape her previous life and she is about to drag Maxim into her dark world.  This is definitely a case of dont judge a book by its cover which was what caught my eye and made me buy the book.

I was afraid of cutting into the material but under the plastic...was another wrap like storage plastic! Lol. As soon as a little air got in to that layer of plastic..woosh..it started to grow.. I began to pull it  out , I felt the thick soft velvety fur. After it was all out, I was in shock wondering how they got that giant blanket wrap in that tiny bag that they vacumed sealed. Its like putting a thick king sized quilt in a bag the size of a book!! Lol. Great packing to keep it all nice and dry. This is so thick, good quality and so warm to wear.

  {"id": 807, "content": "Fanciness over functionality my pair anyways. | VIDEOIDfe0ded02cc8947de907313d213474717 These are pretty, but the obvious design flaw is the extremely sharp scrolled bits that Ive already cut my fingers on several times.  If they had curved the scroll back into itself instead of outwards it probably would have been okay, but as it is it both snags all of your fabrics  threads, but also tears your skin if you arent extremely careful.  So if I keep them I will either cover the sharp tips with glue, file them down, or use a soldering iron to reshape that part of the metal if I can find out if its safe to solder that type of metal.  The other issue I had is that the blades rub together as you can clearly see in the pics as its leaving marks on the metal.  As I intended to use these as embroidery snips I only need to open the scissors a tiny amount so its not terribly awful, but it does limit what I can do with these scissors as I had hoped to also use them for appliqu.  They are pretty  I like the overall design, but the manufacturer needs to fix the handles where the sharp parts are because its damaging to your expensive supplies  your body.  I have large hands for a girl which was the main reason I picked these bc I saw the handles appeared to have larger openings for the hands  they do.  As it has a screw holding the blades together I might try to adjust them to get the blades to be more fluid  not rub together  not dig into each other, but so far it just looks like the engineering is a hair off. The angles of the blades appear as though they will rub even after adjusting.  I hope not because other than what Ive stated I like them.  They have a couple of design flaws, but Im hoping I can work my way around them."},

  {"id": 838, "content": "Not What I Quite What I Expected | I loved the scifi historical angle quite a bit.  The authors perspective was unique and she captivates your interest from the beginning and holds you all the way through.  The book was much longer than it needed to be with many unnecessary scenes.  The characters are extremely well developed and you really want to like them or hate them as warranted.  What Ms. Anderson failed to remember is that while rape and forcible sex may be accurate to the time, it is not why most of her readers choose these type of books.  In my few moments out of my very busy life, I am truly looking to escape.  I am looking for that HEA!  While I understand a single rape scene may have lent a certain amount of authenticity to the book, why did it have to be the heroine?  Sure it showed Alodies strength of character that she could survive anything and bounce back relatively unscathed, but this was quite over the top.  And while we agree to suspend our sense of reality as a rule to even read this genre of book,  Ms. Anderson goes to far in asking me to suspend my sense of reality as a woman, my sense of self worth, to think that any woman could survive the rape of no less than five different men over a period of 2 years and 34just put that behind me34.  It offends me on so many levels I dont even know where to start.  Add that to the fact that the heroine could  want to make love to the hero again and it makes me want to vomit in my mouth a little.  Again, thats just me.  That is just one part of an otherwise great story.  The characters are richly developed, flawed and wholly likable or not as needed.  It really was not a bad read. Just a bit long....like this review!"},

  {"id": 841, "content": "Purchased to Carry in Cars Trunk for Emergencies | I ordered this FOSEAL PORTABLE AIR COMPRESSOR PUMP 12V DC, 150 PSI, Auto Shutoff with Emergency Led Light  Long Cable Red to carry in the trunk of my Honda Accord for emergencies.  I dont want to repeat an incident where my cars Low Tire Pressure warning light came on when I was far from any source of compressed air.  I do forget to check the tire pressure regularly.  Its amazing to me that this lightweight box can be an air compressorand that it can work from an automobiles accessory power socket.  Inflating a tire with this takes only a few minutes.  You just connect the pump to the accessory socket and to the tire.  Then you set the desired air pressure, press the On button, and wait while the pump inflates the tire.  The pump turns off automatically when the preset air pressure is reached.  The recommended air pressure for your tires is usually found on a sticker placed where you can read it if you open the door on the drivers side.  My first choice in a tire inflator is the ASINB015VXWZ9O JACO SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator, but it is currently unavailable apparently the manufacturer is readying a new model.  A portable tire inflator like this one is much easier to use than an air hose at a gasoline station.  And you dont have someone breathing down your neck, waiting to use the air hose, either.  I havent owned the Foseal Air Compressor Pump for long enough to know how reliable it is, or how long it will last."},

  {"id": 866, "content": "Nice product | Im very conflicted on how to rate this product. It did not work out at all for the purpose that I bought it for, but that may just mean that I was expecting a result that I just cant get from using argan oil alone.  I bought this after using the Moroccan oil hair treatment that super pricey stuff with the bright blue label. That oil worked amazing in my hair and I was sad to see just how expensive a large bottle of it was. So I figured just getting regular argan oil would give me the same result, made sense to me at the time since I thought that the Moroccan treatment was just argan oil, scent and some other nonessential ingredients. Well I was very wrong.  So the pros of this particular product there is no scentvery little scent. I couldnt pick up on a scent at all. This for me is a huge plus because I hate the scent or argan oil products. That heavy, perfumey scent about makes me want to gag. I thought that was just the normal scent of argan oil, but apparently it is some kind of added fragrance that companies like to use with it because this product has none of that grandma stink to it. Another plus is that its clear. So it isnt that dark gold color that you will often see. Its a nice sized bottle for the price and it comes with a pump. The pump is admittedly what made me choose this particular brand.  Alright, so the cons. This did not absorb into my hair well at all. I applied a few pumps today after washing and I immediately could tell a difference between this and other oilsserums Ive tried in the past. Normally I can distribute a few pumps through my thick, coarse hair pretty well. This stuff was immediately sucked up though. Like I rubbed my hands together and started applying it, and the oil was just gone. That is when I knew that it was either going to A. absorb really well and turn out exactly like I wanted. Or B. I was going to have oily, coated hair.  Well its a few hours later and my hair has dried into a greasy looking, stringy mess. I really dont know how to make this work in order to get the result that I want. I know that it isnt a matter of using too much product, if I were to use less, it would still just instantly stick to wherever I put my hands and not be able to be distributed well. I do think that I will keep it though because I know that I can use it as a general moisturizer for skin and cuticlesnails and I bet that my hair will feel nice once I wash it out. So I wont be able to use it as a leave in product like I was wanting, but I think that it can be used as a deep conditioning oil treatment where you apply a bunch and let it sit for awhile before shampooing.  So while I am disappointed with it, the fact that it doesnt have that heavy scent means that I can use it still in other ways. If my hair magically dries and turns non greasy soon or if it feels amazing after washing it out, then I will update this review."},

  {"id": 883, "content": "A disappointment | I was drawn to this book because of its timely subject matter, online bullying and harassment. It does cover that subject in excruciating detail, but it has several flaws as well.  34Too Close to Home34 is set in the south of England in the present day and centers around a family of six  Jenna and Jack, the parents Paige, Jennas teenage daughter by a previous relationship and three younger children who are the offspring of Jenna and Jack.  There are three major strands to the novel  Jenna and Jacks new business venture and its startup struggles Jack and Jennas marriage and its breakdown after he is unfaithful and Paiges difficulties at school with a 34reallife34  teenage bully and a mysterious online manipulator whose machinations are almost sociopathic. All of these strands are explored in great detail, and the book is overlong by at least 150 pages.  One problem with this book is the writing.  Everything is spelled out very explicitly.  It is as if the writer never heard the maxim, 34Show, dont tell.34  This author 34tells34 everything, making obvious observations that are annoying and almost insulting to the reader.  It is as if she does not trust the reader to draw even the most obvious conclusion for him or herself.  Both the subject matter and the writing made me think that this is a YA novel, but it is not marketed that way.  It is recommended for people who love Jodi Picoult, but my guess is that Picoults fans will not be complimented by that recommendation.  The book explores the topic of cyberbullying in great detail, and if this topic interests you, you may enjoy this book.  The characters, however, are twodimensional they never really come alive.  For me, the book was a disappointment, though the topic is timely."},

  {"id": 897, "content": "Five stars for versatility, four stars for plastic and fflimsy rubber | I waded through a myriad of blender reviews before settling on the Oster 6in1 Stainless Steel Blender. We used to have a vintage Oster beehive blender from the 1960s, so I knew that it was a brand with a good reputation. The biggest appeal of the 6in1 is its versatility besides the blender jug, it also comes with a milkshake blade and stainless milkshake pitcher, food processor, and baby food jar.  The motor drive is metal, and the blender base is stainless, with a very solid weight to it. So many of the other blenders I researched had plastic gears and components and looked as if theyd break the first time I used them. With 550 watts, this is more like a jackhammer that quickly and effectively makes short work of ice cubes. There are only three basic speeds, and Ive found that pulsing works best, as the motor may work overtime when youre only blending a small amount. Unlike some reviewers, I didnt find the Osters motor to be as noisy as claimed.  Ive used it to make milkshakes and breakfast smoothies ice cubes, almond milk, yogurt and frozen berries, and also used the included food processor attachment to make a small batch of artichoke dip artichoke hearts, garlic, lemon juice and mayo. I have many recipes that will make good use of these additional features. This is a good deal for the money, as it is capable of more than simply blending. I only wish that some of the additional components were built of a sturdier plastic the rubber gaskets are flimsy as well."},

  {"id": 901, "content": "Easy to Use | We upgraded from a 2 camera Arlo system to the 6 camera one. First of all, the 2 camera system that we were using, allowed the cameras to be charged with a cable. The new ones use nonrechargeable ones. Weve been using the new system for a few weeks now, and havent had any low battery notifications, but it is a concern since we have 6 cameras! The system is easy to use. We love being able to access the cameras via our phones. When we were on vacation, we could tell when our pet sitter came to check on the animals. My husband can see when packages are delivered when he is downstairs in his office. We have been using one camera to find out which of our cats is not using the litter box! Theyre really handy. The quality of the images is very good, even when accessing it through our phones. When my husband was setting this up, he had to contact Arlo Customer Services. Evidently, you can only use 5 cameras without any extra fees. It was going to cost money to be able to use all 6 cameras. So as of now, we are only using 5 of them. Overall, we really do like the Arlo system and would recommend Arlo to our friends."},

  {"id": 957, "content": "Interesting but not overly so | I read half the book and could never get that motivated to finish it.  It just wasnt compelling or engaging enough to want to get back to reading it.  The book is categorized on Amazon as being for teens and the book suggests ages 12  up and grades 7  up.  Since it is not overly lengthy just under 200 pages of easily readable, nicely spaced type, a teen could read through it in a short time and wouldnt be overwhelmed by it.  The question is whether or not they would find it interesting enough to truly enjoy it and want to finish it.  Perhaps.  On the plus side, I did learn a few things about the assassination that I either I had forgotten or did not know to begin with.  Not having read that much about Lincoln, am not sure if there is anything new here.  For a teen who is very interested in Lincoln, it would probably be a good addition to their library.  There are about 30 pages of historic pictures throughout the book, which make it far more interesting.  This is a good book for anyone who has trouble reading tiny print now such as myself, due to the very readable, nicely spaced type style.  If this is your first Lincoln assassination book, it is probably a good start to acquaint you with the details, but youll probably want to read a longer, more indepth book if the topic really interests you or you are researching it."},

Its heavy duty as far as the world of toilets go. We had planned to install this in our sons bathroom in the basement. He had a tiny, toilet that was functional, but not comfortable. We took the old toilet out and started the installation. The first trouble we ran into was that the pipe that comes out of the wall was in the way of the base of the toilet. We called a plumber. We thought he could just put a new pipe in place.  Yes, he could do that, but there was another problem. Im not sure of the proper vocabulary, but the hole that goes into the floor of the bathroom where the toilet sits on, was at 10 inches from the wall. This toilet requires the hole to be 12 inches from the wall. So we were unable to even use the toilet in that bathroom! We had to go to the local hardware store and pick up one that would work in that room. Fortunately, the other bathrooms in our house had the 12 inch spacing. My husband was able to install it. We almost ran into the same problem with the pipe, but my husband was able to turn the nob enough so that it didnt interfere with the base. Once installed, theres not a lot of room to access the hose.  The installed toilet works well. Just make sure to measure before hand!"},

  {"id": 982, "content": "OK starter guitar for a kid | Ive been playing over 30 years and got one of these for my 7yearold because he wants to play guitar like daddy does.  For 100 its an OK starter guitar for a kid and I guess really short people who cant play a regular Fender, but not something Id recommend to anyone else.  And my kid thinks it looks cool, so hell be more likely to stick with it.  Even though it has a laminated body, the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood.  The frets are crowned OK but have some sharp ends to them, and I feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed.  Its light and easy to handle.  The hardware isnt bad, with a stable bridge good idea not to put a floating trem in this, 5way blade switch, solid jack and strap anchors, and smooth knobs.  The pickups are not top notch but work well enough a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does, so Im not complaining.  It has a nice red paint job.  On the down side, besides some sharp fret ends, it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be.  The fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret.  The nut on the one I got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side, so the low E string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings.  It has one small pit in the red finish.  It has no paperwork or owners manual.  The tuners are kind of choppy.  And the bodyneck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune.  It comes strung with Fender 9s, which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down, so its good for a kid just starting out.  I actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound.  But as soon as he gets bigger well ditch this for something better."},

  {"id": 1008, "content": "Brother Bear an entertaining adaptation overall | Not having seen the movie, I cant comment on screentoPC authenticity, but KnowWonders Brother Bear game is an entertaining romp through a variety of gorgeous, interactive environments Aspen forest, Valley of Fire, Salmon Run and more on Kenais quest to become human again. The game is narrated by Rutt and Tuke, aka the SCTV McKenzie Brothers of moose voiced by hosers Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis, eh?, who explain the rough idea of Brother Bear brothers Sitka, Denahi, and Kenai live in the Ice Age Pacific Northwest. When eldest brother Sitka is killed by a grizzly while protecting Kenai, Kenai tracks down the bear and kills it against the advice of the shaman. As punishment, he is transformed into a bear and must escape Denahi, who is now hunting him. Kenai befriends Koda, an orphaned grizzly cub, who helps him reach the place where the light touches the earth. The game begins in the Apsen Forest in a training level, where Koda teaches Kenai the bear essentials how to jump, climb, collect honeycomb to discover secret totems, and collect berries, salmon, and acorns to restore health. Interspersed between levels are arcadestyle action games, such as racing to the top of the mountain, the Ice Run, and collecting the most salmon at the Salmon Run. These can be replayed to achieve a better score, or just to enjoy the action again. Although there are no difficulty levels to choose from , the game increases in difficulty with each level. During each level Kenai must fight and escape Denahi. This is made difficult in the fact that once you enter the fights, there are no health powerups, and if you die, you start right back out with as much or as little health as you had the first time. The saves are also automatic, and the game freezes up for a good 1520 seconds every time it saves. The claim that you can transform into an eagle, wolf or crow is deceiving these are totems that you use in your quest, but you do not actually transform. The Eagle totem allows Kenai and Koda to fly to otherwise offlimits ledges and across barriers to collect bonus items the Mystical Pinecone, which gives you an extra heart against the hunter and to continue the game. The Wolf allows you to jump across superwide chasms you only use it once or twice, and the Crow allows you to see hidden objects or paths. There are also three totems that will aid you in your final fight against the Hunter the Bear, the Sabertooth Tiger, and Golden Salmon. As a bonus, if you collect the six hidden totems, there is a hidden ending. The 3D graphics are gorgeous lush forest, snowcovered mountains, raging rapids and waterfalls, and volcanic craters. You can chase rabbits and butterflies for fun, fish for salmon in the river, and avoid grumpy chipmunks when collecting berries. The game did freeze up on my machine in a couple of spots both in the Valley of Fire, but those were the only glitches I encountered. Brother Bear does require a 3D graphics card and a fair amount of memory to run smoothly I ran it on an HP Pavillion with 256 MB RAM and an Nvidia TNT 64 MB graphics card. Overall I feel that the game is too difficult for younger gamers under six perhaps the keyboardmouse controls are rather tricky and very sensitive, but enjoyable for older kids."},

  {"id": 1024, "content": "A nostalgic trip down Memory Lane at Schulers | Having grown up in Michigan, I have many fond memories of Sunday brunches at Schulers in Marshall, Michigan. Originally opened in 1909, Schulers is a Michigan fixture that specializes in heavier traditional dishes such as prime rib and London broil. The attached pub, Winstons, features some lighter bar fare such as the classic Schulers Bar Cheese and barbeque meatballs.  Jonathan Schuler represents the fourth generation of Schulers behind the restaurant. He serves as narrator and guide to the many traditional and updated dishes featured in Schulers Fresh Recipes and Warm Memories. Classics such as Schulers Bar Scheese vastly superior to the bland supermarket variety Schulers sold the recipe to Cambells Soup in 1982 and barbeque meatballs sit sidebyside with more contemporary offerings such as Goat Cheese Gratin, Savory Pesto Cheesecake, Creamy Sauteed Morel Mushrooms, and Baked Artichoke Hearts with Bread Crumbs and Fresh Herbs.  Sandwiches includes such gems as Roasted Vegetable Panini with Handmade Hummus and Feta Cheese, Schulers Classic Reuben, and Fresh Basil, Tomato, and Camembert on Grilled Sourdough.  Soups include Schulers divine Seafood Chowder, Midwest Corn Chowder, Pumpkin Bisque, and Michigan Bean and Vegetable Soup.  From the lakes and oceans, we have the Perfect Crab Cake, Broiled Whitefish with Herbed Butter a Michigan delicacy, Grilled Salmon with Balsamic Vinegar Roasted Beets, and Hazelnut Crusted Walleye.  There is also a large assortment of meat and gamebased recipes such as Venison Ragout, Venison Loin with a Cherry Cognac Sauce, Prime Rib, PanRoasted Duck, and London Broil.  To round out the collection of favorites, there are also numerous recipes for bread, salads, omelettes, pastas, simple and delicious vegetable sides Roasted Asparagus with Pine Nuts, Cauliflower with Lemon and Herb Butter, alcoholic beverages, and divine desserts, including Schulers classic Baked Alaska.  The cookbook is beautifully presented, featuring a very informative introduction about Schulers origins and family ties, changes that the restaurant has undergone across the decades, and numerous photos of the restaurant, including overlays of the many famous literary quotations painted along its walls.  Recipes are clearly presented stepbystep, many with an informative introduction from Jonathan Schuler on preparation and presentation, and the included photographs are mouthwateringly gorgeous. Jonathans guidance is easy to follow, with no fancy equipment or techniques necessary, so this is a perfect cookbook for the beginner as well as the professional. This is a beautiful tribute to a Michigan dining institution, and one that brought back many happy memories of dining at Schulers over the last twenty years."},

  {"id": 1030, "content": "Healthy eating in a hurry  perfect for busy weeknights! | I own and have reviewed several unofficial Trader Joes cookbooks and cook from all of them regularly, so was excited to see The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joes Cookbook. Its no secret that one of my favorite stores on the planet is Trader Joes. I first discovered them while still living in Michigan, and it would be an eightyear wait before my city in Texas got their first store in the meantime, I would smuggle home suitcases full of TJs mannalike cookie butter and dried fruit. Although I currently live 8,000 miles away from the nearest store and will for the next several years, I have a hefty supply of shelfstable TJs products that friends and family are kind enough to send in care packages.  So I was excited to see the new release The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joes Cookbook Over 75 Easy, Delicious Recipes for Every Meal. A freelance illustrator, author Bonnie Matthews was hit hard by the economic downturn in 2008  and also saw the end to a sevenyear relationship. She had gotten up to nearly 300 pounds before deciding that she needed to change she started cooking healthier meals using Trader Joes products and eventually lost 130 pounds through a combination of healthier eating and working out. Her employee discount at Trader Joes meant that she had the chance to create delicious recipes that would let her stick to her newfound healthy lifestyle I had to make peace with food and make better choices or I knew that I would not be able to survive. Dr. Oz dubbed Bonnie a Wellness Warrior on his show and gave Bonnie a blog on DoctorOz.com this launched her journey as a cookbook author.  Something that my loyal readers may not be aware of is that I lost and have kept off around 35 pounds for the last 15 years. Starting in junior high and high school, I began to pack on the pounds onto my 51 frame through a combination of junk food, soda, candy, and lack of exercise. In high school I weighed about 125 by the time I earned my BA from Western Michigan in 2003, that number had ballooned to over 140 and I barely fit into a size 12. I had finally had enough and changed my habits and diet drastically I started to exercise every day, cut out regular sodas, stopped eating fast food, switched to whole grains, fresh vegetables, and lowfat dairy, and gradually adopted a vegetarian now pescetarian diet. In a matter of months, Id dropped over 30 pounds. Some of that weight had crept back over the last 10 years in Texas in large part because of the extreme heat, lack of sidewalks, and places to exercise outside, but last year I finally got back down to my grad school weight that I hadnt seen since 2006.  The gorgeous photography which Bonnie also shot and easytoread font make this easy to cook from number of servings can be found on the upperlefthand side, with a fullcolor photo for each recipe appearing to the right. There are lots of international influences to keep dinner interesting, from Moroccaninspired tagines to Greek chicken with eggplant and onion, Thai red curry with roasted kabocha squash and shrimp, pork tenderloin medallions with rosemary marinade, and pasta dishes. Each recipe comes with a brief introduction from Bonnie with additional tips, tricks, and info about specific ingredients. Although the recipes rely on shortcuts TJs frozen veggies, sauces, etc, there are minimal highlyprocessed ingredients. Because of this, prep times are very reasonable, with many of the main dishes on the table in 30 minutes or less.  Whether youre looking to make a healthier lifestyle change or are simply looking for new ideas for delicious, healthy weeknight meals, The Eat Your Way Healthy At Trader Joes truly has something for everyone!"},

There are some draggy parts where he describes Andys movies in too much detail but the description of Andys life in the 70s and 80s made up for that. I was at MOMA not too long ago. Theres a lot of Warhol stuff but I didnt realize the museum ignored him until after he died. Would like to see the Warhol museum."},

There was even non descriptive intimate scenes. Eden was born a sinner because she was predestined to be a killer for the devil. She runs into a group of demons who are trying to be good by saving the world from people like her. They temporarily agree to save her life and try to stop the devil from using her. That was the general idea of the story. The only con is that there is a cliffhanger ending that I dislike but understand. I will continue with the series."},

I am concerned with that not being enough to hold him securely in place. Most inflatables that we have, have more than just 2 stakes. Most have loops at the base for stakes in addition to the side ropes that you stake down. I tested it out in the living room, but when we put him outside after Thanksgiving, Im going to suggest to my husband that he finds some additional way of securing him down.

  {"id": 1047, "content": "Does a better job than cheaper antennas | Previously I had purchased a cheaper antenna that was not powered, as this one is.  It worked pretty well and got quite a few channels.  This one, however, works better and a few more channels come in clearly and consistently.  I tried it too without the USB power and it still works well, but without the power, not all the channels came in.  For the little extra that this costs over cheaper antennas, it is worth it.  The long cord on it is a wonderful plus, as you can position it quite a distance from the TV, unlike cheaper antennas that may have shorter cords.  The only thing I can see wrong with this is that since it is powered, it does use some electricity, whereas cheaper antennas dont.  Probably not really much electricity, but as we add more and more devices to our homes, those energy vampires can add up.  I suggest trying it with and without the power.  If you dont use the TV every day, unplug the power.  If you have pets that tend to chew things, watch out for them with the long cords on this.  Very satisfied with it and may get another one for other televisions in the house, once we cut off cable, which we are doing soon.  You recover your cost of the device with just one month of cable.  Extremely easy to installunder 5 minutes."},

Brown Sugar gathers traditional Southern comfort desserts such as lacy wafer cookies, pecan sand tarts, gingersnaps, chocolate spice cake, a fluffy coconut peach cake, pineapple iced cake, cobblers and pies including sweet potato and spicy molasses pecan, puddings and custards, candies and homemade ice creams. In terms of repertoire, its similar to Patty Pinners ASIN1580087981 Sweets Soul Food Desserts  Memories, but White includes numerous helpful hints for presentation and howtos.  There are no photographs, but the recipes include introductions that explain the origin of the recipes and handy sidebars. There are also numerous substitutions and variations suggested if youre looking to branch out, or perhaps to experiment with a more adventurous flavor combination like substituting cardamom for cinnamon in a coffee cake. Theres a chapter devoted to fruits, so if youre looking for a lighter finale, youll find numerous baked fruits and compotes. These foolproof gems are a wonderful way to slow down and reconnect with a simpler time, and the delicious smells that will be coming out of your kitchen are sure to attract friends and neighbors, who might then sit down for a welldeserved chat over a slice of freshly baked cake or pie."},

  {"id": 1068, "content": "This is your big box game pick | Caverna is not for everyone, but its pretty close. Its a big box game, meaning it has a LOT of components, and for people who arent already into board games, it might be a bit overwhelming. Its not actually that hard to learn, but its more complicated than, say, Kingdomino.  At the core, its a worker placement game like Raiders of the North Sea, with nods to Kingdomino and even Castles of Mad King Ludwig. To me its the quintessential worker placement game. Agricola has a lot of the same mechanics but is more punishing. This is a better experience for more players, or for those newer to board games and who might be reluctant to learn something that looks so vast. And it is vast.  The complexity comes mainly in the form of 1 how many actions you have to choose from, and 2 how many different rooms you can build. Once you learn the basic game flow, the rest will start making sense the more you play. Caverna is a game where the strategy runs pretty deep. You will continue to notice new things every time you play.  As I said in the title of this review if you need help picking your big box game, let me help you out pick Caverna. If your group of friends is a more hardcore gamer group that plays many different games, you might want to go for Agricola instead. If youre not sure, just get this one. For the same price as Settlers of Catan, you get a lot more. Much wider support for number of players, expandable boards, tons of components, and even a solo play mode. The components are well made and satisfying to use.  I really cant think of anything negative here. It does take some learning, but not much compared to other big box games. As a gift it is probably best to consider smaller or less expensive games. I would want to know the person I was gifting it to was a super board game geek before buying this for them  but then, if they were a super board game geek, theyd probably already own it. So the gifting value is a bit limited."},

  {"id": 1077, "content": "A decent overview of SeaQuests firstseason score | The shortlived scifi series SeaQuest DSV went through a number of rotating composers in its threeyear tenure, but John Debney scorer of television, theme park, and motion picture soundtracks such as ASINB000008123 Cutthroat Island and ASINB00006359N The Scorpion King created the shows Emmywinning theme song and the pilot score. Other regular contributors included Don Davis and Russ Landau.  The SeaQuest soundtrack features original score from three firstseason episodes the pilot To Be or Not To Be, Knights of Shadows, and Such Great Patience. It opens with the dashing, proud Main Title, also known as the SeaQuest theme. Full of bright trumpets and sweeping scales on strings, it sets the theme amply for a show focused on Earths last frontier deep sea exploration and colonization.  The majority of the other tracks are onscreen action cues full of tensionfilled snare strikes, cymbals, and threatening brass underscoring onscreen battles. The main theme weaves in and out of the various tracks throughout the CD, such as morphing into a soft, dreamlike lullaby on Bridgers Dream. In Darwin Speaks, a flute carries the SeaQuest theme as a haunting panpipe represents Darwins first attempts at computerized communication throughout early episodes, Darwins cues would make use of panpipes.  To be quite honest, I bought this as a diehard fan, and its most likely only to appeal to diehard fans, since all the tracks sound the same e.g., the SeaQuest theme is reprised on each, but its a nice souvenir of the shows first and in my opinion, the best season of SeaQuest DSV that sonically captures some of the onscreen highlights. Debney does a more than capable job of bringing excitement and wonder to Earths last unexplored frontiers the oceans."},

Seriously though, Nesco is a really wellknown company and they make several different models of dehydrators. Depending on how heavy your usage, you really cant go wrong with this brand, no matter which model you decide on. I know a few people who also have Nesco dehydrators and have nothing but positive things to say about the company.

  {"id": 1138, "content": "Gorgeous collection of mustvisit restaurants and accompanying recipes! | My first introduction to 34Cult Recipes34 was last years 34Tokyo Cult Recipes,34 which I cant recommend highly enough. The 34Cult Recipes34 books are a virtual stroll around some of the worlds great cities Venice, New York, Tokyo, Istanbul, with detailed maps, itineraries, and supporting recipes to match. The included photographs capture the vibrant people and places, as well as mise en place and various markets and ingredients.  Turkish cuisine is probably my favorite and I have numerous Turkish books in my collection, so I was eager to see how this would stack up.  From the gorgeous goldembossed cover to the unique blackandwhite cartoons, 34Istanbul Cult Recipes34 is a fantastic love song to the city. True to Turkish cuisine, the bulk of the recipes are for meze, including a vibrant beetroot couscous, chopped salad with walnuts, and purslane salad, kebabs, pilavs, and vegfriendly mains lentil kofte, hot salads, blackeyed peas with tomato, sarma, etc.. The street food chapter introduced me to some new favorites I had no idea that giant baked potatoes were popular outside the US, while the 34Sweet Things34 chapter doesnt disappoint with kadayif, kunefe, muhallebi, kurabiye, lokma, Turkish delight and baklava. I loved the pumpkin dessert and baked quince ideas. The illustrated pastries and condiments, grains and pulses, and dried herbs and spices charts were also tremendously helpful. Recipes are listed in metric  US volume  US weight measurements, which I greatly appreciated more and more UK titles are doing this thankfully!.  The recipes themselves are simple and straightforward, and most dont require extensive prep or cooking time, making it easy to prepare several dishes to be served together, as is the tradition in Turkey.

  {"id": 1142, "content": "Great for raclette grilling and not much else cord is a bit short | Know what you are getting if you order this, as it wasnt quite what I expected.  I thought I was more or less getting a conventional twotier two surface grill if there is such a thing, but this is really designed best for preparing raclette.  Raclette is a Swiss specialty and generally consists of potatoes or other vegetables and sometimes bread that is grilled and then covered with cheese.  The bottom portion of the grill has 8 tiny grilling 34pans34 that are best used for melting the cheese that goes on the food that is grilled on the top.  I guess you could also use the tiny pans to grill other small items or cut up pieces of vegetables.  The heat for the 8 pans comes from the top, so keep that in mind.  The single heating element is under the top grill pan, so it provides heat upwards for the top grill surface and down for the small grilling pans.  Since heat rises, you might get more heat at the top than the bottom, but I couldnt determine that for sure.  I thought this would be great to use to grill something inside when the weather is bad outside.  One main problem is that you cant grill anything that has any significant amount of fat, as the top grill pan has small outer edges and the grease has no place to go it just sits on top of the grill pan.  Thats a less healthy way of grilling, as the grease does not run off, plus if you get too much grease it will overflow the pan, going into the bottom or onto the heating element.  Potentially I guess you could have a grease fire if that happens or at least a smoke problem when the grease burns when it hits the hot coils.  So forget trying to grill burgers unless they are very lean.  Best for a small amount of meat or pieces of meat that has very little fat.  Otherwise you will have to keep wiping off the fat accumulation.  You also wont get the taste of flame grilling that you get with a regular BBQ grill.  The only other problem that I noticed is that the power cord is very short, so you need an outlet very close to where you will be grilling. You might be able to use a heavy duty extension cord, but generally that is not recommended for anything that heats up.  If you are familiar with raclette and have it more than once in a while, it might be worth getting this.  It is good for up to 8 people who could each have their choice of cheese.  If you dont expect to use this very much, probably not worth getting and storing for the time you are not using it.  Unless you eat raclette often, It seems more like a novelty item for use once in a while. In a way, it is not unlike fondue.  Many of us had fondue sets that now are unused, once the novelty wore off.  Even my George Foreman grill that does have a cup to hold grease runoff sits unused for a long time, because it involved a lot of cleanup after use this one will be even worse in terms of cleanup because all the grease will sit on the top grill plate.  You have to wipe off the grease because if you wash it in the sink, the grease can potentially clog your drains.  This is really designed to grill low fat or no fat items, such as bread, vegetables and maybe small pieces of meat that is very lean.  Seems like a fun party item to introduce raclette to those who are unfamiliar with it.  Nothing really wrong with it just an item that generally is designed for a very specific type of grilling and not suitable as a general purpose grill."},

I am told by people I call that the phone sound clarity is very adequate I am understating the case  I was told it is perfect including over the SYNC system in our SUV. We were able to port our phone numbers from our old carrier  just be sure ATT has your correct information from your former carrier account. We did have a glitch, but ATT quickly fixed things. ATT also solved other problems in a way that was very beneficial to us. I cannot speak too highly of both their tech support and billing employees. They have been superb!  Bear in mind that if you are used to smaller flip phones, for example, the size of this baby takes a little getting used to however, this slight impracticality is outweighed by all of the things this phone can do.  There are apps for everything under the sun, and many, many are free. We are using GasBuddy, WeatherBug, FastFood Nutrition, and Lotto, to name a few.  Our data package with ATT gives each of us 3Gig of data per month. We are averaging under 10Meg a day, so we are well on course. When we use a WiFi network, we get unlimited data use and no usage charge against the 3Gig allotment. We may be able to cut back to a 300Meg plan and save on the monthly charges. If any of this turns out differently over time, I will update this section of my review.  If you are looking to take the next step in hardware, I am confident that you will be very happy with this choice. The ATTNokiaMicrosoft relationship is a good one for us customers!"},

  {"id": 1168, "content": "A wonderful coming of age memoir of a young Freedom Rider | This is the single best comingofage memoir I have ever read. I have read and enjoyed many.  It is 1961, and eighteenyearold Charles Person needs his parents permission to become the youngest of the original Freedom Riders of 1961.  James Farmer of the Congress of Racial Equality CORE led up the plan to test the right of black and white people to use nonsegregated interstate buses and use the facilities and amenities in the bus depots. The U.S. Supreme Court decided a pair of cases establishing these rights, but blatantly segregated buses, waiting rooms, depot restaurants, station restrooms, and even shoeshine stands remained the norm in the Jim Crow South.  This was the freedom ride that led to the iconic photo of a Greyhound bus burning in a white mobs effort to stop the Freedom Riders from continuing on their journey  actually, to kill them if possible. Pearson was on the Trailways bus that Mothers Day, but his team was not spared.  They were beaten to a pulp, enduring lifelong medical problems from their injuries, these black and white men and women fighting for equal rights for people of color.  I was a sevenyearold white girl in a conservative city in Pennsylvania when they rode, with a mommy who was a civil rights activist and a daddy who supported her work.  I heard about the burning Greyhound bus and had a rudimentary understanding of the lunch counter sitins and Jim Crow.  Some years ago, I read the voluminous, amazing, and scholarly book on the 1961 Freedom Riders by Raymond Arsenault.  Ive read articles and interviews and thought I got it. And then I read Buses Are a Comin Memoir of a Freedom Rider.  I dont say this to make a point about me.  I say this to remind us all that there is more to learn There is always more to learn. Always more that can bring deeper understanding.  This is an eloquent, beautifully written, and compelling book, with wonderful use of the protestfreedom songs of the era. It is a different telling of a wellknown story.  Its strength lies in illustrating this two weeks in May 1961 through the eyes of a very young man with a year of college and some protests and sitins under his belt.  Persons voice is authentic.  He shares enough to help us understand how he processed and experienced this journey  leaving Georgia on a bus for the first time, working with famous activists, training for nonviolent responses to violent treatment, breaking bread with supporters, befriending the older white riders on his team, and moving on, moving on until they were too battered to take one more bus.  And when they could do no more, hundreds of others took up the job for the rest of that summer, riding buses all over the south in various groupings by race, sitting in the wrong seats, always an observer riding as a regular customer to help out if the others got arrested.  We know that and certainly, Ive tried to imagine what it was like to be part of this harrowing summer made up of many individual journeys.  Person lets us in.  He takes us on the bus and tells his very personal story and he does it engagingly and freshly."},

On the plus side there are vitamins in this oil but no retinol so it is good for my skin. Goes on a little oily, takes a while to absorb. My skin does feel softer since using, havent really seen a significant difference in elasticity or in the fine lines crows feet around my eyes. On the negative side, at over 40 I dont think this is worth it. I have some really great facial serums at 30 of the price that, in my opinion, work much better."},

I was able to remove what I didnt want and add what I did want quickly and easily.  I use it for email... play a few low challenge games pogo and stream a movie once in a while.

  {"id": 1217, "content": "Feels better than stock to me, and the sweat doesnt absorb into leather. | Positives 1. Sweat cleans off easy, not hard to install and the included eye cover is functional. I find it works better with my frankenquest adapters at holding things in place than the stock foam. It bounces on my face less ands doesnt require as much tension. 2. This does seem to work better at keeping my face cool that just the silicone covers for the stock foam. Negatives 1. There is still a bit of light bleed out the sides, but its not bad unless you are in a really bright room and you can only tell in dark scenes. I have seen other adapters including side cushions to repair this issue. 2. The nose piece doesnt stay on well, and when it does it presses hard and leaves a mark on my nose. Its still rubber so its not painful, but there has to be a better solution. Maybe cut it lower or make it a bit more flexible. If you remove it there is a lot of open area in your lower vision.  Overall I recommend it over a silicone cover for the stock foam, but it has a lot of downfalls so I am sure this isnt the best option for a new face plate."},

Matilda was sweet, innocent and sometimes a little naive. So together a perfect match. Jason, a magician, meets Matilda at her fathers solicitors law office when he attempts to hire her dad to take on a big newspaper. What she doesnt know its that Jason is a former childhood friend that has an elaborate plan centered around revenge for his family and avenging Matildas loss. What follows is epic love, action, a ton of suspense and a good romance. The plot was good. I couldnt even fully guess what was going on and the reason behind Jasons obsession with taking down Una. The ending floored me but in a good way. There is a happily ever after. There were perfectly written naughty intimate scenes, so this is definitely not a young adult book. This book was written in British or is it Irish English so there were words that made me pause but it didnt completely takeaway from the novel. I truly enjoyed the story and the writing so I will save this author on my like list."},

  {"id": 1282, "content": "glass bottle soap dispenser | I purchased 2 of these.  The bottle is a clear, ribbed glass  the pumper is plastic tubing and a brushed stainless pumper.  I was nervous because I was going to use these with a pretty thick hand soap and the blue dish soap  which is also fairly viscous.  The opening of the bottle is big enough I did not need to use a funnel  which I initially tried  but the soap was too thick to make the funnel work.  After assembling the pumper to the bottle I cautiously pumped the top  they do need to be primed  but after about 6 priming pumps  the soap dispensed!  In both cases.  Victory!  I was so happy!  They both pump a very economical measure of soap  sometimes I pump twice to get a more hearty amount  but I think it will help in not wasting the hand soap and the dish soap.  They also come with cute wooden tags and a silicone coaster white to prevent slipping  which will happen once there is water around the bottle.  I chose not to use the wooden tags. I know which soap is which and I think the tags would quickly become kinda yucky.  But thats just my opinion.  They are not overly tall  about 6 or 7 tallor wide at the bottom Im thinking about 3 12 to 4 in circumference  meaning they dont take up much space and look so much tidier.  Being glass, they are easily rinsed off.  I think if you really wanted to clean them in the dishwasher top rack you could  but they are easily enough washed by hand.  Overall, I am very pleased so far.  Having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."},

The plots and twists were really good, and I am a fan of detail, but this author beat around the bush plenty. The series could have ended in tops Book 6.  The biggest problem for me was...  SPOILER WARNING This book constantly went back and forth between Skyla choosing who, and when, and why, and etc. Every time she deliberated, the author would describe each candidate in full detail and say why he shouldshould not be chosen. How things ended up, and obvious since all the visions come true, would have been nice to get to QUICKLY. Ok, so the whole Logan thing needed to be kept secret.

  {"id": 1291, "content": "Keep reading...and then keep baking. from Dorie Greenspans introduction | Johnny Iuzzini, winner of the James Beard Award for Outstanding Pastry Chef and recognized as one of the 10 Most Influential Pastry Chefs in America by Forbes, delivers a home run with his second cookbook. Sugar Rush with an introduction by Dorie Greenspan is a fantastic primer for all aspiring pastry chefs and home bakers. Approachable and gorgeously photographed, each chapter opens with a mother recipe complete with stepbystep photos demonstrating the proper technique, then you are given numerous opportunities to try out your new skills on a tempting array of desserts in the same family.  Every major type of dessert base is covered in gorgeous photography and stepbystep guides, from caramel, custards and marshmallow to yeast and laminated doughs, cookie and tart doughs, and glazes, frostings, fillings and sauces. Johnnys pastry cream flavors were particularly inspired pintildea colada, coffee cardamom, tarragon vanilla and blackberry pastry creams mean that youll never lack inspiration for a cream puff or eacuteclair filling. And his primer on meringue includes French, Swiss and Italian meringues as well as sabayon, semifreddo, and mousse.  His flavor combinations are appealing and inventive, including banana fritters with tahini caramel cream, chocolate sesame seed cake, and a root cake features parsnips and carrots. One of the standouts for me was his apricot custard tart, made with almond flour and pistachios. Impressive yet fairly straightforward to assemble, this is a showstopping dessert made with a few simple ingredients. Another similarly French tart is the gorgeous strawberrytarragon tart, inspired by a fraise des bois tart while Johnny was working at Ladureacutee in Paris under Chef Pierre Hermeacute. Im also eager to make the doublecrust caramelwalnut tart for the holidays a variation of the Swiss Engadiner, an almondenriched tart dough surrounds a filling of caramel and walnuts.  As a diehard ginger lover I eat candied ginger straight out of the bag, I loved the gingercurry sugar cookies, and the play date cookies brought to mind the mamoul my Iraqi students used to bring to class. The addition of a spiced filling cloves, cinnamon was a welcome addition to what is traditionally a very sweet filling. Another instant favorite is the spicy malted chocolate chipotle brownies dense and fudgy, a sprinkling of Demerara sugar lends crunch, while chipotle, smoked paprika, and cayenne provide a hit of heat and depth.  I own nearly 50 pastry and baking books, including several professional pastry textbooks, and I can say with absolute certainty that I will find myself coming back to Sugar Rush again and again for its winning combination of clear explanations and photographs and appealing recipes. Unlike some other pastry books I own, you will not have to seek out expensive, hardtofind ingredients no gold leafdust, powdered ube, or molecular gastronomy required! to end up with showshopping desserts, and the solid foundation on basic pastry techniques will serve you well on your future baking adventures.  If you are at all interested in baking  pastry, this is one book you need to have in your collection. Or as Johnny succinctly puts it, Once you grasp some fundamentals, you are limited only by your imagination. Happy baking!  Review copy provided by Blogging for Books"},

  {"id": 1295, "content": "One of my favourite books! | This is the kind of book I live for! I absolutely loved it. Give me a book about the sea, creatures of the deep with a supernatural or horror twist and you have me from hello. I have been craving a deep sea horror for a while and after reading a few of Peter Benchleys books last year I had a big hole left to fill and then this book came along and it was spectacular!  There are so many characters and all are so well written that there is bound to be ones you like and ones that really get on your nerves. For me the main character Tory is kinda cardboard but there are so many other colourful characters throughout that the main character being distinctly blah didnt really matter in the bigger plot. Diverstiy is key here with this many major characters all playing big parts in the overall story and even with the multiple view points throughout the book I never once felt like I got lost or confused by it.  The horror aspect of the book felt so real even though you will keep reminding yourself these are mythical creatures that you want to lock yourself in a safe place whislt reading and will most likely never be able to watch Disneys The Little Mermaid again. These mermaids are like nothing you will have come across before and if you think you are safe as a woman because mermaids only lure men to their deaths, then this book will turn your fairytale world upsidedown. They do not discriminate! Meat is meat to them and they are scary as hell.  In the picture, the creaturethe mermaid was facing away from the camera, pulling itself along the Atargatis deck with clawed hands. Its tail was broad and flat, more like an eels than a dolphins and while the substance growing from its scalp could have passed for hair under the right light, it was clearly something else  A heads up for the nonscience people that love a good horror, there is A LOT of science jargon in this book so parts of it may drag if that is not your thing. For me personally as a zoologist, the scientific detail blew my mind especially the siren necropsy and I couldnt get enough of it. The author obviously did a huge amount of research when it came to this book as the detail was immacualte. If it had been another 400 pages about their findings after the voyage ended then Id have happily have kept reading. I loved, loved, loved this book and would give it ten stars if I could."},

  {"id": 1297, "content": "Wonderful Easy Read on the History of Transplants! | Spare Parts is a very readable history of the evolution of transplants of human body parts, from skin grafts through heartlung and covering many centuries. Craddock gives us the science involved in an accessible manner.  The entire book is my favorite kind of history, full of social, political and cultural context.  From earliest times, we receive stories about the scientists and inventors who figured out what worked.  We learn the impact on human lives from both the donors and the recipients and the surgeons perspectives.  At its worst, we find that in fact there are stories of peoples organs being stolen and of dirt poor children in England selling their teeth so the rich could have prettier smiles, only to find tooth transplants either dont work or dont last long.  At its best, we learn about the invention of dialysis by a Dutch researcher and successful kidney transplants.   I am old enough to remember Dr. Christian Barnard and the first heart transplant, the handsome guy who was as much a celebrity at the time as he was a renowned surgeon.  This book has great illustrations.  Tantalizes us with current research that includes a picture of a spinach leaf with heart cells growing on it.  Horrifies us with the number of animals who died in the many experiments that led to this work.  Craddock writes with mostly a this is what happened  and this eventually was the backlash, manner. But he cant help expressly recognizing the values of those who crossed serious ethical and inhumane boundaries to get where we are.  He writes with humor, compassion and makes everything very, very personal.  Id love to sit around and hear him talking in a living room at a pot luck dinner about his work.  Well done!"},

The worst thing about this flat iron is the power onoff.  Its SUPER annoyingly difficult.

I hate leaving less than 5 star reviews, but sometimes, things are just 3 stars in real use.  Hopefully they will rethink the power stuff and make it a normal, easy to use system.

While I dearly love the bird print, I wish the back ground was whiter or a very soft ivory but mostly I wish the material in the back would have been a much better quality.  A sham at this price should be better.  The front print material feels like a really rough cotton linen.  I havent washed them yet  and because of the material, Im a little concerned.

None of them seem too fond of it they do use it occasionally, but mine seem too dumb to notice the hole on top. Whenever I try to feed them via that hole, only one of them consistently notices and eats the food. Thus, Ive found it useless as a feeding aid, though my bettas do know its there.  Part of the problem is there is no way to tether it to anything, so most of the time it floats in circles due to the low flow from my filter. This irritates my fish and they seem less interested in using it. If it could be tethered to the side of the tank, I think they would like it better and probably even sleep in it. I have caught one of them sleeping in there, but not very frequently.  As an ornament, it certainly looks natural and is a great addition to an alreadyfull tank, since it does float. As anything but an ornament, its not so great. Considering that, I think its a little overpriced, but maybe some bettas would like it better than others. I would recommend the leaf hammock by far over this item."},

  {"id": 1370, "content": "A solid, emotional pagetoscreen translation of a young adult classic | Jane Yolens The Devils Arithmetic is a classroom fixture and a benchmark in young adult literature for its vivid yet sensitive portrayal of the Holocaust.  In this Showtime madeforTV adaptation, introduced and produced by Dustin Hoffman himself from a family of Polish Jews, the novel is brought to life in a way that shows younger viewers the horrors of the Holocaust without being overtly gory.  Modern teenager Hannah Stern resents being made to participate in her Aunt Evas Passover celebrations, feeling no attachment to her religion.  As her relatives, all concentration camp survivors, try to recount their experiences, Hannah turns away, bored.  All of this changes as Hannah is chosen to perform the ritual act of opening the door for the Prophet Elijahinstead of the hallway of her aunts apartment, Hannah is transported to rural Jewish Poland, circa 1941.  Hannah attempts to make sense of her old life, and the girl her new Polish family expects her to be.  As time passes, more and more of her old life becomes a dream.  Hannah and her cousin Rivkah explore the town before attending a wedding, at which point Nazis round up the wedding guests and load them onto trucks.  The remainder of the film focuses on the daytoday struggle to live in the concentration camp in powerful moments of stolen identities the grim shearing of hair, the painful tattoos of blue numbers, the bitter cold and backbreaking labour.  Although this is a childrens film, there are plenty of grim realities the beating and hanging of several men who attempt to escape, women suffocating in a gas chamber.  Several previous reviewers have mentioned inaccuracies swing music, banned by Hitler in 1938, is played in a lounge, but despite the small flaws, for a lowbudget film, it captures the drama and power of the original novel.  Much of the original plot has been changed, mostly for the better, but readers may find some transitions confusing.  The films acting, cinematography, costumes, and sound editing are all topnotch.  There are moments of quiet beauty, of love that transcends time, of the will to survive against the odds.  Kirsten Dunst gives a stunning performance as a spoiled teen that learns the meaning of ultimate sacrifice, cherishing her heritage and religion when confronted with the horrors of the Holocaust.  An excellent companion to the novel, and a good introduction to the Holocaust for young teens."},

  {"id": 1397, "content": "A Stellar Debut Novel | 34Make Your Home Among Strangers34 is one of the best new novels by a firsttime author that I have read.  It tells the story of the first year actually from November to August of college for Lizet, a bright Cuban American young woman who gained admission to Rawlings, a very competitive liberal arts college think Williams or Cornell, for which she is woefully unprepared.  One strand of the novel deals with her experiences at school, especially her feeling that she just does not fit in and will not succeed no matter what she does.  As the novel begins, she is paying a surprise visit to her mother and sister in Miami for Thanksgiving.  Just at this time, Ariel Hernandez think Elian Gonzales has been rescued from a raft on its way from Cuba to Miami.  Ariels mother dies on the way, and Ariels relatives mount a campaign to keep him in America against the wishes of his father in Cuba.  Lizets mother is very interested in this child and his family, and as the months go by she becomes increasingly invested in the fate of little Ariel and his main caretaker, a young woman named Caridaylis.  Lizet and her sister Leidy, who has a child, Dante, by her exboyfriend, become very concerned about their mothers mental health, as she detaches from her real family to participate in the demonstrations on behalf of Ariel and his family.  This second strand is woven into Lizets experience as she tries to figure out just who she is and where she belongs.  Suddenly she seems to fit nowhere she has no place to really call home.  Her Cuban family and friends mock her intelligence and new interests they feel that she has 34forgotten where she came from34 and that she thinks she is too good  for them now.  Lizet herself is uncomfortable both at home and at school, where people take for granted things she must learn.  College is a totally new culture for Lizet, one that she has to navigate in fits and starts.  I have never read a better account of the problems facing young people who transition from one cultural milieu to another.  Whether you are a working class white person in an Ivy League university, a young African American from the inner city who attends a private or toptier public school, or a Cuban or Latin American or Native American student in a similar situation, you will be able to relate to Lizets anguish as she deals with both collegerelated and familyrelated issues.  Dont get me wrong  No one is openly racist or mean to Lizet there are no slurs or putdowns.  But there are more than a few misunderstandings that lead to anger and hostility.  Lizet is unsure of herself, and her uncertainty makes her defensive her college friends make insensitive remarks and are oblivious to how they are perceived by Lizet.  Most of the students at Rawlings are from privileged uppermiddle class or upper class families, and their air of entitlement is both palpable and unconscious.  Book clubs will love this book.  So many issues lend themselves to discussion, such as affirmative action, cultural identity, and coming of age.  The characters are almost all exasperating, especially Lizet and her sister Leidy, and their mother is beyond the pale in her devotion to the cause of Ariel Hernandez note that Ariel is a near anagram for Elian.  The writing is excellent, and I look forward to reading more of Jennine Capo Crucets work.  I cannot help but think that this is at least in part autobiographical, so well does it express Lizets experiences and conflicts.  I recommend this book to anyone who seeks a better understanding of the cultural differences that we all encounter in our pluralistic society, and especially to anyone who, like me, loves books about school."},

  {"id": 1409, "content": "charging ports break after exposed to weather for a while | So I owned two of these cameras argus eco.  They work okay  miss a lot of events but that was not the biggest problem.  I had both charging continuously with a solar panel.  For some reason I had to take them in at some point because they were not charging.  Reolink support recommended charging them indoors with the usb.  Each of the two times I did that, the charging port sunk so far into the camera that I could not connect it.  After dealing with this for a while with Reolink support, the bottom line was that since it was out of warranty, there was nothing they could do. By the way, one of these was a replacement camera they sent for a different issued that was only  6 months old but they do not count the warranty from that, they count it from the original purchase date.  So this happened on a camera that was only 6 months old as well as one that was a little over two years old.  Since I could not charge the camera, it was not usable so I decided to take it apart to see what the issue was.  The pictures show that the connection port is thinly attached to a computer board.  The computer board is held in place pushing the port up through the connection hole, simply with tape.  So the tape dried out and now slides down see pictures, taking the port with it when you try to plug in.  This is a ridiculously simple problem to solve by the company.  They should simply screw in the board to the part that holds it in place.  So now I have two cameras that should work well, one I destroyed by opening it up but dont because there is no way to charge it.  Also, the soldering that connects the port to the board is also very weak.  It super easily broke off when trying to fish it out with tweezers.  So, I might be stupid in that I ordered two more reolink outdoor cameras a different type this time.  If the charging ports are built the same, I expect to have the same problem in the future.  Then this will truly be the last outdoor reolink camera that I will ever purchase.  The only reason I stuck with it is because it offers local storage.  I have no interest in paying for a subscription or having my images on a cloud...although I will likely reconsider that if these two new cameras fail as well.  To those of you that have not yet run into this problem, maybe try to find a way to secure the porrt now, before you lose it to drying out tape."},

After being given a sedative, she makes a run for it and ends up out cold on a park bench in Rome, where newspaper man Joe Bradley discovers her and begrudgingly takes her home with him, fearing for her safety.  He quickly pieces together her formal, outdated manner of speaking and the disappearance of the princess official reason sudden illness, and his first inclination is to cash in on her secret identity by writing a tellall story for 5000. He enlists his friend Irving as photographer. But as Joe indulges Anns simple wishes for gelato, sightseeing, and a dash of adventure, he finds himself genuinely falling for Ann. The two engage in a complicated tango of avoidance Joe hides the fact that hes press, and Ann tells him that shes run away from school.

The ending is bittersweet yet appropriate, neither too much nor too little. Roman Holiday is a stunning vehicle for the luminous Audrey Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her performance, was the first comedy for Gregory Peck, and most of all, serves as a showcase for the timeless wonders of Rome. It was the first American film to be shot entirely in Italy Paramount had frozen assets in Italy. Real Italian nobility and real international press corps were featured in the film. Most of the locations exist, and the colorful, authentic backgrounds and ethnic faces add a degree of authenticity that could never have been matched in a California studio.  There are several extras including a documentary on the films restoration, a stills gallery, and the original trailer. The transfer is crisp enough and looks fresh despite its age. Roman Holiday will appeal to fans of romance, comedy, and travelogues, and is a mesmerizing blend of all three elements."},

The included helicopter is supposed to carry Thomas off to safety after he escapes the shark, but obviously thats something that occurs only in a childs imagination.  The helicopter is just an extra included toy and can stand alone.  Its not a bad toy and the engine is cute and well made.

As a werewolf movie fan, I watched this movie and it did NOT disappoint  even though its not really a werewolf movie  there are wolves.  Its a little off Broadway as they say  but I thought the production was good and the story is compelling.  Its not going to win Oscars for all, but it is entertaining and isnt that what its all about.  Things are not as they seem in this story  I hesitate to give too many details so as not to give away the end.  It is rated R for violence, gore, language, nudity, some sexual content  so its not really for the very young ones or people with weak constitutions. For adults,  in my opinion, its worth a watch. Not really a true horror flick in the true sense of the genre, but it has its moments.  I purchased this movie via stream so I dont have to store a DVD.

Then it manages to get a solid amount of icing out of the tub and allows me to evenly spread it all over my cakes.

The staggered layering of the boxes pattern prohibits the tracking of most dirt into the house. However, I did find the mat to be pretty lightweight. Both of my children are now grown and out of the household, so I believe for my purposes this mat definitely does the trick. I am not sure if, given the weight, it would work as well for a larger family. I loved the Closed Boxes patern and find it to be a great alternative of the traditional, oldfashioned Welcome pattern. The Coco Fiber is strong and makes a wonderful material of almost a hemprope feel. I would highly recommend this floormat for most people."},

The feet are rubber or like tipped so they protect the stainless steel sink from scratches.  It is small, but its only the two of us and I have a dishwasher.

I finished it BECAUSE it was well written, but I would not have read it had I known what was coming. Some of the blurbs at the beginning of Ones Company called it a Black Comedy.  I did not laugh once.  In fairness, the novel is well written, hangs together, has some great characters and Bonnie Lincoln and how she proceeds when she wins a bazillion dollar lottery is amazingly wrought.  But it is a sad, introspective book about a very damaged woman who needs to live as  a character in Threes Company to survive. Bonnie is a woman in her early twenties who has only ever had exactly one friend.  Both her parents are dead and you would not call her family one that was memorable in a good way.  Shes recently gone through a horrible trauma, coming out of a situation as the only survivor if you want to call it survival. Somehow, the old sitcom, Threes Company, comforts her and she becomes obsessed.  When she wins the biggest lottery ever, Bonnie creates an alternate world for herself of the Threes Company set and sets things up so that she will live alone there and be one of the characters from the show each year, moving from apartment to apartment, but always existing in the 1970s.. We already know the concept of this novel going in.  Its in the blurbs. Personally, the best thing about the book, is what I THOUGHT it was going to be.

Divided into a fairly standard arrangement of starters, soups, salads, sandwiches, noodles, vegetable, grain and legume combos, sides, brunch and egg dishes, and desserts, most of the recipes feature no prep since you use prepackaged convenience food from the supermarket such as presliced and chopped veggies, bagged salad greens, canned beans, and prepared hummus.  The recipes are also clearly labeled as lactoovo, dairyfree, eggfree, and vegan many recipes contain a vegan option. Roughly half the recipes are vegan or can be prepared as such with minimal alteration. The recipes are easy to follow, and many feature variations. Detailed nutritional info is included for each recipe.  One of the things I especially liked was the inclusion of delicious international recipes from Asian Toasted Potstickers with Wasabi Cream, Miso Soup with Pot Stickers, Asian Noodle and Broccoli Slaw Wrap, Japanese Vermicelli in Peanut Sauce, Coconut Sticky Rice Pudding, Mexican Easy Appetizer Burritos, Mexican Bean and Tortilla Soup, Bean Enchiladas with Green Sauce, Spanish Tortilla, Mexican Rice Pudding, Italian Fresh Mozzarella, Cherry Tomato, and Basil Spears, Hearty Minestrone Soup, Pesto Pizza with Fresh Mozzarella and Cherry Tomatoes, Penne with Red Pepper Cream and Pine Nuts, Baked Pears with Caramel and Amaretti, and Middle Eastern Artichoke Bottoms with Hummus, Chickpeas with Curried Mayonnaise, Moroccan Vegetable Stew over Couscous.  Each recipe is introduced by a brief, helpful paragraph including the authors advice on preparation, presentation, and possible substitutions.  The recipes are quick and easy as promised, many with minimal prep andor clean up, so this is a lifesaver for hectic weeknights, and vastly superior to bland, unhealthy frozen dinners or transfatladen takeout.

The quality of some of the tools is just average, but more than adequate for the beginner. Everything fits in the canvas tote, but there are no compartments or pockets inside, so you are unable to organize it.

On the 3rd day she was in a luke warm hot tub for over an hour  it was falling off by the time she got out. It was fine before that after her daily showers. She did complain less while it was on, but I wasnt really sure how it did. Then last night, I woke up with knee pain. It was bad enough that I was considering getting some ibuprofen. It was hurting every time I changed positions, which was frequently or if I had to get out of bed. First I grabbed a knee brace, but they were just too uncomfortable for sleeping. Some were too tight, another one kept rolling down. Then I remembered about the VARA KT tape. I got it  put it on  almost immediately the pain was nearly gone. I noticed a huge difference. It was comfortable for sleeping. However, in the morning, some of the edges were beginning to come up and after my shower, it was falling off. In all fairness, I applied it with very little light because it was in the middle of the night  I really dont think I was following the anchoring directions properly. I applied some more tape after my shower  so far, so good. I am just amazed at how good my knee feels right now. Update Ive changed my review from 4 Star to 5 Star. I am amazed at how well this worked on my knee. The pain was gone after 3 days, so I removed the tape."},

In the beginning, though, she was raised on takeout and it wasnt until her midtwenties that she gravitated to Jewish observance. The 34Bride Who Knew Nothing34 was at first clueless about cooking joining her husbands family meant celebrating more than 100 traditional holiday meals annually for the immediate and extended family. Thankfully, Jamies experiences learning to cook kosher have benefitted the rest of us with the newest Joy of Kosher cookbook youll find dependable, delicious recipes that can be dressed up or down for the occasion, many using pantry staples that you already have on hand.  As soon as I got my copy, I put a sticky flag on any recipe that looked interesting my book soon looked like a colorful porcupine! I ended up trying Uputzis Vegetarian Chopped 34Liver34 Pteacute, Butternut Squash Mac n Cheese, Blue Cheese, Pear, and Arugula Pizza, Country Spinach, Tomato and White Bean Soup, Hearty Mushrooms with Herbs and Wine phyllo cup variation, Cold Soba Noodles with Sweet Sesame Tofu, Gooey Chocolate Cherry Cake, CranRosemary Challah and SunDried Tomato, Garlic, and Herb Braided Challah.  The book opens with a compact equipment and ingredients list and a brief overview of 34the kosher thing34 no pork or shellfish, no mixing meat and milk in the same meal, and processed foods require rabbinic certification. Recipes are clearly labeled with kosher status meat, dairy, or pareve, prep time, cook time, and number of servings. I also loved that every recipe comes with ideas on how to dress it up, dress it down, make a meal, and variations that allow you to get several results from a single dish. Each recipe also has a suggested kosher wine pairing as well. Instructions are simple and ingredients should be readily available at your local supermarket this would make a great housewarming or wedding gift as it is approachable by any level of cook.  I loved all of the recipes I tried and found they worked exactly as written for the bread recipes, I used Voilagrave! Hallah Traditional Egg Bread Mix and combined them with the various toppings  fillings from the challah chapter. My absolute favorite find was the Vegetarian Chopped Liver  Ive tried other vegetarian chopped 34liver34 recipes in the past that were bland and forgettable, but this one is AMAZING. A puree of toasted walnuts, mushrooms I used cremini, garlic, onion, thyme and chopped hardboiled eggs, it is meaty and satisfying and is wonderful on bread, crackers, or as a sandwich spread.  I loved experimenting with the 34dress it up, dress it down34 variations I tried the butternut squash mac and cheese both ways I split the batch and made half in an 8x8 pan and the rest as the suggested muffin cups, which made perfect individual servings that I then froze for a quick and easy snack or light meal. There are nods to Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Israeli cuisine, Asian I loved the cold soba noodles with sweet sesame tofu, Mexican blackened tilapia tacos, skirt steak with salsa verde, Middle Eastern, kidfriendly recipes...in short, something for everyone even vegetarians like myself will find plenty of quick, tasty recipes to try. The dessert chapters deserve special mention as well, with many impressive cakes and cookies I loved the cardamomscented Chanukah cookies, candiedorange cheesecake, gooey chocolate cherry cake, and the olive oil dark chocolate mousse shots.  There are suggested holiday menus at the back with a very thorough guide of how to adapt the given recipes for Passover, a brief food glossary, and a more comprehensive HebrewYiddishYinglish glossary.  Jamie herself sums it up best 34Food is an expression of love. And it doesnt matter if youve never eaten kosher, always eat kosher, or go 34kosher casual.34 Whats important is that food brings us together, and we all want to share our best, most delectable meals with the people we love. And when its kosher, were also pulling in thousands of years of love and tradition.34  Review copy courtesy of William Morrow  Joy of Kosher"},

Sure, as the author describes, human rights are too often the casualty, but, as have been said by many others, the arrow of history points forward. Specially, world poverty has been minimized coincidental with finance, so, likely because of finance human beings run finance and are neurologically wired overwhelmingly for justice.  That being said, I agree with the author that more can be done to further human rights, like with better regulation and redistribution, and the book does offer many ways to do this.  Throughout history, the wealthy always have had advantages, however excessive wealth doesnt always bring happiness. There, the author seems to ignore.  Anyway, I do recommend the book because finance is an important topic, especially since the Great Recession and income inequality is perhaps the biggest casualty of the recovery."},

You get three pair, each a different color.  I received one black, one red and one tortoise shell.. the colors are subtle, not terribly flashy.  There are some tiny rhinestone type stones on the temples as shown... gives them a little flair...  My one disappointment is that they did come with handy wipe cloth bags to carry them in.  So, you will need to purchase some bags to keep them from getting scratched too soon.  The lens are bright and  clear.  They are also FULL correction lens, NOT bifocal.

It was having a difficult time getting it on our WiFi at first. He called customer support and they were closed. Evidently their hours are pretty much 95 on MF. Most working people are going to have difficulties with that. We panicked a little because connecting it to the WiFi was one of the last steps. This was a chilly Saturday and we didnt have a working thermostat. One option my husband was considering was reinstalling our old one until he could find the time to call customer support, but that would involve another trip to the attic. He chose another option, which was pressing the reset button on the back of the thermostat and it restarted the process. That did it and it was able to connect this time.  My husband used the website to set up our daily schedules. My husband works at home a couple of days a week and we have a son in college who lives at home, too. Because of those factors, we couldnt use the app to enter our schedule. If you have a more simple schedule, you can do that on the app. It automatically changes from heating to cooling which our old thermostat didnt do.  Its a little smaller than our old thermostat. Because of this, I will be repainting my kitchen a lot sooner! It does look nice and the numbers are easy to read for my old eyes.

I could barely read past the oddly flowery first chapter, but was glad I kept on as The Devil You Know is a passably entertaining, solid three stars mystery.  Evan Hobbes, a famous  actor with a previously impeccable reputation, has been accused in a viral video of engaging in sexually inappropriate conduct with minors during the course of his career.  And now he is dead.  Maggie Nolan catches the case, faced with a question as to whether his fall from a cliff while at a party was accident, suicide or he was helped out.  In a side story, Sam Easton, who was apparently a character in an earlier book in the series, is still finding his way, plagued by PTSD and faced with career decisions as he is ready to work again.  This entry develops love interests for both Nolan and Eastman.  A central character is Hobbes agent, Seth Lehman, utterly unlikeable in a number of ways and brother to the host of the party where Hobbes died.  Seth hates the owner of his agency and wants out.  Hobbes was his biggest client, but he has another fish on the hook, an old love interest who made it big and a very angry girlfriend who doesnt appreciate how he treats her.  All in all, the characters are fun to follow.  The plot is find.  The writing except Chapter 1 is entertaining."},

How Stiller, a rabbi, Norton, an Irish Catholic priest, and Elfman, an Irish Catholic gal struggle to balance these is a joy. The supporting cast is terrific also, especially Anne Bancroft as Stillers mom. It is brilliant how such serious issues can be dealt with in such a light hearted and comical way. The fine soundtrack also compliments the movie. One standout tune is quotHeart of Mine,quot sung by Peter Salett at the end of the film.

  {"id": 1620, "content": "More entertaining adventures for Tempe, more of the same | Bare Bones is the sixth novel in the Tempe Brennan series, and as such builds upon previous characters, past events, and past plots, but hey...if the formula works, dont mess with it. Brennan, like author Kathy Reichs, is a forensic anthropologist who works between North Carolina and the province of Qubec identifying causes of death and IDs remains too badly mangled or maimed for local experts including the occasional animal.   In Bare Bones we find Tempe back from her expedition in Guatemala the setting of her last novel Grave Secrets about to go on a muchneeded and longanticipated beach vacation with detective Andrew Ryan, a colleague from Montral. However, a series of ominous events derails her leisure time a newborns charred remains found in a crack house, a downed drug plane, a cache of bear and human bones on a farm, and missing federal agents draw Tempe into another sinister web of deception, danger and death. A mysterious stalker, the Grim Reaper, threatens all that Tempe loves by leaving chilling snapshots as seen through the scope of a highpowered rifle. What has Tempe stumbled onto? This time around and much to my consternation, Tempe spends no time in my beloved Qubec. That was one of the draws that I loved so much in Dj Dead the vivid descriptions of La Belle Province, the descriptions of local Montral hangouts and restaurants, the charming qubcois touches, all set Kathy Reichs apart. In Bare Bones, however, Reichs grounds Tempe in the South. I loved the research about Melungeons a subject of great interest to me.  Melungeons meaning cursed or lost soul live in the Appalachians and are believed to be descendants of Portuguese sailors, Roanoke survivors, First Nations, and possibly Turkish slaves among others, but overall the book seemed to cover less new ground than past outings. Similarly, the three plots are much less loosely connected than in previous novels. The budding romance between Tempe and Ryan was very deftly and gently carried out, although Ryan is not actually present for most of the novel. Tempes Green Party rants at the end of the book seemed incongruous, more a political statement than in character for Tempe, but overall Bare Bones is another enjoyable read from Reichs. I only hope the next novel is set in Qubec once more."},

I dont hear nearly as much background noise as far as air conditioner units, refrigerators, and things like that that usually get in the way of being able to hear and understand clearly. Its very lightweight and fits very well inside my ear without falling out like my other hearing aids because I have a small ear.

  {"id": 1647, "content": "The Choices we Make  Riveting PostWar Story of a Holocaust Survivor | Rachel Perlman is married to Aaron, a Flatbush Jew.  It is the earlymid 1950s. She is a displaced person from Berlin, Germany, a Jew who survived the Holocaust and is left with the knowledge her mother perished in a gas chamber. Rachel has suffered deep trauma over part of what she did to survive.  Rachels uncle Feter Fritz also survived after internment in a camp and he also lives in New York.  He was her mothers art agent and was something of a raconteur..  Shadows of Berlin brings together the fragments that are Rachels life, from childhood, when she was jealous that the cat had taken to her mothers beautiful model to that model becoming dangerous to them, as well as other Jews in Berlin when she becomes a catcher for the Nazis, identifying and arresting underground Jews.  We experience chapters focused on this modelmuse, Rachels mother, and others caught up in trying to survive, tumbled up Rachels memories and ghostly interactions, throughout the novel.  We are privy to a fifties marriage where the nice enough Aaron wants his wife to keep the apartment clean and have a baby. Instead she cracks up at work and spends a night at Bellevue and now she needs to see a costly shrink. We are let into the past and the present that is Uncle Fritz, who lives in poverty and continues to look for the main chance to be the mover and shaker he was in prewar Berlin.  We meed Aarons family, witness a Seder with the typically odd mix of extended family, his sister Naomi who is a rebel and smokes pot, his mother whose gifts to Rachel always reflect something where Rachel is personally lacking. Aaron has family.  Rachel has ... Uncle Fritz, who always wants something from her.  I like the choices Gillham made when he wove the story from present 1950s to prewar and war years in Berlin not long ago yet treated in New York almost like ancient history.  Rachels life included starving on the streets of Berlin trying not be be caught, facing transport to camps and having to sell at least part of her soul to live one more day, with no future guaranteed.  When she looks back, she is forced to reconcile decisions made in a completely deprived past with a bountiful life in  the United States.  There is excess of everything and to those around her the knowledge of Nazi atrocities is  abstract. Most of them saw it in movies shown of camp liberations.  Aaron didnt even serve overseas, but in California, working on USO shows. People around Rachel are horrified, but they are not damaged like Rachel and their efforts to understand her fall short..  The characters are welldeveloped, often humorous, and most are just trying to make it in their world, some with less success than others.  This was definitely a cant put it down novel for me in part  because of the array of characters and the choices each make.  Some of those we get to know best are Rachels ghosts, among them her mother whose voice is strong in Rachels mind and not always kind.

The fine vocal performances by German star countertenor Andreas Scholl and young New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra were the icing on the cake. Mr. Scholl has a large repertoire of English lute songs, and the songs he is featured on With Wandring Steps Milton The Floor of Heaven, and How Sweet the Moonlight Shakespeare fit him like a glove. Hayley Westenra sings the enchanting Bridal Ballad.  I was not previously familiar with Jocelyn Pooks scores, but was quickly enraptured by the tender combination of delicate harp, recorder, majestic viol, and above all, the Middle Eastern flavour imparted by Sephardic melodies Paseabase el Rey Moro, Synagogue Cantors, Ghetto that briefly slip in and out of the score Courtroom Drama, Last Words, Fie Fie Gratiano. The Merchant of Venice score holds up well as a standalone work of atmospheric music that feels right at home next to my large collection of Spanish Sephardic music, Cantigas, and Renaissance  Baroque music. The addition of work by Andreas Scholl I own almost all titles in his Harmonia Mundi catalogue, Hayley Westenra and other vocalists boy sopranos, boy choirs, Israeli singers and synagogue cantors makes the score even more effective by offering brief interludes to break the monotony of many interrelated instrumentals.  The Merchant of Venice soundtrack is a mustbuy for anyone interested in Sephardic, Renaissance, or early vocal music sure to delight fans of Andreas Scholl and other countertenors and early music."},

I found far more advanced features that I didnt even know were possible previously. My recent trip to Yosemite was uploaded using the Photoplus digital studio and I was able to zoom, crop and change backgrounds, etc. What a phenomenal experience for a first timer like me.

There are a lot of features I didnt yet have the opportunity to use, but hope to within the next month. I will add more comments to this as I become more experienced.

Idk on the cups is driving me batty. Im disabled so my gait is not great to begin with  the lid just bangs nonstop while I walk from my kitchen to wherever Im going with my tea. Its incredibly annoying.  I had hoped it was just a oneoff so I purchased it in another color  sadly it has the same exact problem.  They could fix the problem by adding a rubber gasket or flange to the lid imo  I even thought of doing so myself until I accidentally knocked the cup over due to a design flaw that has a small base on the cup.  I like the lid bc I run a fan continuously  I live with 2 service dogs so I like to keep my drinks covered beyond just the brew times so I really hope they update this cup bc it does keep the tea warm  the size is perfect for a 2 cup brew.  I wish they would fix the obvious design flaw of the base that is too small for a cup that tall  wide bc it is also very easy to accidentally knock over as I mentioned above.  I did it several times before I yet boxed them both back up.  Overall I like the product as it seems as it was made with quality in mind, but missed the mark in the design phase.  The colors are pretty  the cups I purchased keep the tea warm, but the lids are either defective or a design flaw.  I really hope the company fixes these issue bc the colors match teapots I already own. Lol.  I intend to see if the company has another design that works better for me in the meantime."},

I have an average width foot and find this very comfortable across the top  not too tight, not too loose.  However, everyones foot is different, so I would honestly suggest you try on a pair to find just the right fit.  It was easy when there was only one 34type34... now they have so many different styles and I find they each fit differently.  This particular style features 34memory foam34 soles and they are particularly comfortable because of that.  They feel like youre wearing a really high quality slipper around.  Very lightweight.

We also see the mystery with Heather wrapped up and discover who the traitor is. There is still a ton of action but not a lot of growth with the characters. Aurora still frustrates me with her silly actions and words and I do try to see her as strong but one step forward and two back. I liked the chemistry with Cristiano and if he will be her Bellator in the next book... I am okay with that. I like Ayden and dislike love triangles so Ill stop speculating now. The book ended with questions which leads me to believe this isnt a trilogy and honestly I am okay with that. The books are good enough to be a series.

Incidentally, there are two companies that are authorized resellers of Baofeng radios, and the BFF9V2 is only sold by this one, Firstvision Technologies aka Amcrest in Houston, TX.  This model is essentially the same as the BFF8HP with a slightly different shell design which looks more conformal and ruggedized to me.  This BFF9V2 comes with a BL5 1800mAh battery that slides and snaps easily in place securely and conforms in size precisely to the radio itself.  The battery can be charged  by itself or with it installed on the radio using the same charger and cradle. The assembly, shell, switches, and buttons on this BFF9V2 are rock solid and actually has the Baofeng name molded in the plastic in more places than the BFF8HP.  .  .  and its a 9 which must be better than an 8, right?

Also the shirt seemed a bit too roomy as well, so if you are a large person, it should fit perfectly.  Even though the pants are long, they could probably be easily shortened without compromising the integrity.  The only real problem is the care instructions.  You have to wash this in cold water.

There are not a lot of reasons that you would want to put your phone there, but if you do, then know that its strong enough to hold it there. This wallet style phone case is perfect for my daughter to use. She doesnt usually carry a purse with her, but she always takes her phone with her.

Your phone goes into the twopiece beige case, then the encased phone goes into the teal case with rubber bumpers.  Finally a black, hard plastic cover with a belt clipkickstand protects the glass display.  There is no screen protector incorporated into this case.  This DEFENDER case fits my Galaxy S9 phone snugly, but it is also fairly easy to remove if necessary.  I think it provides a LOT of protection for the phonecertainly it protects against moderate drops and minor contact with other items in a tote bag or backpack.  However, it adds quite a bit of bulk and weight to the fairly large S9 phone, and the belt clip on the black display cover sticks out far enough to make it awkward to pick up or lay down the phone.  The belt clip functions as a kickstand when the phone is in landscape orientationexcept that it takes considerable finger strength to snap the clip backwards into a fixed position.  The phone will fit either face up or face down into the black cover, but this extra beltclip piece is clumsy to handle.  The case covers the phones buttons, which all work fine with the case installed.  At the bottom of the phone, two hinged sections of the rubber bumper close the charging and earbud ports, to protect against water incursion.  This is a wellmade, goodlooking case, but its too bulky and complicated for me.  I prefer the Otterbox Symmetry case, which I carry inside a synthetic leather holster that has a  belt clip."},

There are three singles, one in Australia and two in England, that each feature nonalbum mixes and Bsides.  The So Beautiful Part 2 single features four tracks 1. So Beautiful Spikes Radio Edit, 2. Something In The Sky, 3. Truly Madly Deeply Medley Live 4. So Beautiful Lee Groves Mix.  The Spike Stent mix is the track used in the So Beautiful music video, and has a bit more of a pronounced rock edge than the album cut, with a greater emphasis on electric guitar and marked percussion.  Something in the Sky is a BSide that sounds like it came from Darrens first solo album Spin 2002, and is reminiscent of Crush 1980 Me from Spin, with peppy vocorder effects.  Truly Madly Deeply Medley is from Darrens Too Close For Comfort Tour and combines I Knew I Loved You and Truly, Madly, Deeply  in a live lovefest thats heavy on the falsetto and on the long side at seven minutes.  The Lee Groves So Beautiful mix features more of an electronic sound, with a New Agechillout vibe that makes me want to light incense and whip out my yoga mat. It also plays up Darrens falsetto never a bad thing on the chorus by bringing the backing track to the front and making the chorus sound almost as though it was filtered through water.

The underarm area is fine meaning the arm holes are not too large and I pulled it on easily without unzipping the side zipper.  On the side zipper  it is a hidden zipper with a metal head  so you can feel it under your arm.  This is very important the material content!  96 cotton and 4 spandex  most of the spandex is in the top tank portion of the dress. This is important for cleaning and considering sizing.  Cotton will shrink some.  Sizing up is probably a good idea with this in consideration. The dress is surprisingly light weight  super light really.  I was expecting it to be heavier. The directions instruct Gentle wash, DO NOT bleach DO NOT tumble dry and cool iron.  Meh.  Iron??  NOT my favorite thing to do and so if you are planning to travel with it.. plan on pressing it. Of course, a crisp, pressed cotton can look nice  but is a pain. On my hour glass plus body the dress hits me just barely below the knee, before washing, which is my personal fav.  I did attach a pick showing the capris I plan to wear with it because I hate my knees so much.  Remember  the capris are mine and do not come with the dress.  The picture doesnt do me or the dress justice  the dress draped nicely no lumps or rolls as it was loose enough on me  the pooch seen is a pocket popping out  other areas that look like rolls are just print and how I am standing. Honestly, no rolls from my body.  I am hoping once the dress is properly pressed  the pocket edges will stay where they are supposed to.  The skirt is slightly see through as well.  I am wondering if a fun little slip that poofs out a bit might be fun with this.  But a regular slip might be good if youre not doing capris like me.  I LOVE navy and white and this print is bright, clear and crisp  to me it screams springsummer  just with the navy and white print.  The top tank is navy, and v necked.  The v does show cleavage on me  but not in an obscene way  in my opinion  sorry my cell hand is blocking that area.  I purchased a navy shrug to wear with it  for warmth  living in Oregon  even in the summer, at night, it can be cool  the navy shrug is not a perfect match in color but very close and I think it is complimentary.  Finally at the price of this dress, considering how few times I will probably wear it, its a worthy purchase  not quite 5 stars for me no ironing would have made that more appealing but definitely a dress that will work for may different events  my nieces summer wedding... a tea... luncheon meeting.. I probably will not take it with me for travel as I never desire or have time to press things or send them out  just my personal choice!

Ghost stories, graverobber stories, tales of people raised by wild animals, zombie stories, humourous stories, even modern tales based on urban legends. Each book is prefaced with some history, and their are annoted sources and extensive bibliographies. There are loads of creepy, morbid, and yes, scary illustrations throughout the book in ink and grey watercolour...very gravelike. Some of them still creep me out today years later. Some of them might give you nightmares and resurface in front of you when youre all alone in the dark.

Highland Jewel is the second book in her Scottish history Royal Highlander series and after reading Mays previous book in the series Highland Crown I didnt think it would be possible to top that but she did!  Maisie Murrays sweet, docile exterior masks the courageous spirit of a firebrand determined to champion womens suffrage with likeminded friends. But fighting for her principles has swept her directly into harms wayand into the arms of a man she cannot resist.  A trained officer with the Royal Highland Regiment, Niall Campbell has spent his life serving the Crown. Battleweary and searching for peace, he nothing to do with troubleuntil he meets Maisie. But unless Niall and Maisie can find a way to stand up to the destructive forces that threaten to divide them, longburied secrets and political schemes are destined to stand in the way of the glorious love theyve found  Something I love about these books are the fierce but very real characters that May McGoldrick brings to life through her books and Maisie, Fiona and Niall are no exception. The history is rich and from page one as a reader you are thrown into the political turmoil of the late 18th and early 19th Century Scotland and England. There is plenty of background story to flesh it out and even though the story goes between two time points it is still easy to follow.

To summarize Paine, the mechanic instantly falls in love with his customer Penelope Duchess. He later finds out she is getting married to a local friend of her father and proceeds to sway her into breaking her engagement and choosing him. So there was a very tiny bit of suspense to give the story depth but..its still has all the raunchy bits that you expect. All in all a good quick read."},

My mechanic put new windshield wipers on my Toyota highlander for the winter, and they were awful. Then while out if town my husband bought a new pair from the autoparts store, which cost 40.00 that still didnt take the water off My windows.  The problem is, when the wipers  came back up on the drivers side, it brought up more water with it. Needless to say the last two sets of wipers blades have been a disaster. Never has this happened before, and I usually Buy a new pair every winter. Live in a snow area.  When the Motor Trend wiper came up, I figure I would give them a try, I had nothing to lose at this point. My husband could not get it on, and took my car to our mechanic.. Omgosh, these actually clean my windshield, and do Not bring the water back up. Im thrilled needless to say, and are going to buy the other wiper blade  for the right side..  5 stars.

  {"id": 1815, "content": "Interesting and Provocative | I selected Light from a Distant Star because I had previously read some of the authors work and enjoyed it, especially Songs in Ordinary Time.  Mary McGarry Morriss latest effort is not quite up to Songs, but it is worth  a read nonetheless.  Light is a coming of age story that will appeal to both adults and adolescents, though I suspect some of the nuances of the book will be lost on teens.  The central character, 13yearold Nellie Peck, is beautifully drawn, with all the innocence and confusion of her age.  She prides herself on having what Holden Caulfield called an excellent BS detector, and she struggles to remain true to herself, even when family, peer, and other pressures mount.  Each character in the book is  facing some sort of crisis.  The parents are facing imminent financial collapse, and each deals with it in diametrically opposite ways the older sister is trying to reconnect with her birth father the younger brother is trying to overcome shyness and insecurity.  A wider circle of friends, relatives, and neighbors each has his or her own eccentricities.  In the midst of all this, a murder occurs, and Nellie finds herself the star witness.  Ultimately she has to decide not just whether or not to do the right thing, but what the right thing is in the first place.  This novel has been compared with Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird, but I think the comparison is not merited.  Whatever the chaos in Lees book, it had a moral center, Atticus Finch, that was solid and true, around which the entire narrative circled.  There is no real moral center in Morriss book, which makes the confusion of the central character very understandable.  This is not to say that none of the adult characters are good, but rather that they are compromised by financial need and societal pressures.  In this respect the title tells the reader a great deal  The starlight we see comes from a star that no longer exists.  Is the author suggesting that modern life has no moral absolutes?  Are we left with only the residual light of a moral universe long past?  In any event, I do recommend this book.  It held my interest, with realistic and welldrawn characters and a wellpaced story line.  Readers will appreciate that Morris rejects easy and simplistic solutions to complex problems."},

Im huge into comfort, and these definitely are a comfortable pair of boots right out of the box. You might be wondering why I gave the 3star review! The reason is for the subpar construction of the leather upper. I added a photo to show you what I mean. I am generally pretty gentle on shoes. Im one of those people whose yearsold Uggs look pretty freaking brandnew. I had only worn these boots a couple of times and somehow managed to scuff the front of the boot beyond repair.

It has a very useful light  makes fair hair more visible and the cordless aspect of it is awesome.  However, I learned a few things about using this particular epilator. .. One, it doesnt work as effectively if you move in a circular motion  like with the original older style removers.  I found it barely removed any hair using that age old method.  What worked better was going in a slow, steady straight line.  Its a bit more painful this way  but if you want the hair to come out with this particular hair puller, you gotta do that.  You may be wondering about how long the charge lasted... it lasted long enough for me to do both calves... but couldnt last with enough power to add your upper leg thighs..  Now... of course this will be different for everyone I think  depending on how much hair you have.. how long you linger to remove that hair.. how much hair you want to remove... etc.  Also, to be fair, you should know that exfoliating before pulling hair definitely helps the process be more effective, however, you will never get a smooooth finish... like with a razor shave.

The quality is superb and the price is very fair real leather of good quality for only 38.  A snap connects the inner leather sleeve  glove to the folding zipper case, which acts as a base and back so you can view the Kindle in portrait or landscape on almost any surface including an uneven bed  even when your leaning nearby on the mattress makes the case slope slightly forward.  Theres plenty of air space around the sleeve along with openings for charging, onoff, volume control, and the speakers. Because of the good airflow, it runs 23 degrees centigrade cooler than when flat on a surface. My Kindle was getting too hot laying on my bed and had occasional freeze problems because of the heat. No more!!  The case itself is made of high quality leather and has two zippers so you can zip from either side.

These dolls are about 4 inches shorter than the traditional American Girl dolls. The target audience is a little younger than the AG audience. I think its a nice transition between baby dolls and the American Girl doll line. Evidently there are books that go along with the Wellie Wisher dolls, but its not included. Here you basically get the doll and her outfit which includes the Wellie boots, hence the name of the collection. Ashlyn looks like she could be Hispanic or Latin American. Regardless, I am pleased to see some diversity in the collection. Shes really cute and seems to be well made. This model is a newer one.

  {"id": 1897, "content": "Not bad for the money, but not great | Let me start by saying some positives about these planters. First, I was surprised at how big they were. Guess I couldnt tell from the pictures their size. The larger one could easily plant a small tree in i.e. if you were in the south, you could plant a small orange tree. Second, they were heavier and sturdier than I anticipated no fear in leaving it on the patio and having it blow over. What I didnt care for it was the color first a super drab grey, the feel of the pot some kind of a metallic and most importantly the fact that there is no drainage in the bottom not good for root rot. I planted a rose bush in the large one to put out on my outside patio. Given that I dont have any kind of drill to make a hole in it, I am just hoping that the watering I am doing will not collect on the inside of the planter to harm the plant I have several inches of potting soil beneath the roots and the bottom of the planter. I am sure, if I were handier or if I was more of a horticulturist I could have figured out how to solve this dilemma. Follow up 06042011 Well, the inevitable happened. Without drainage holes in this, my rose bush died last year. There was so much collected water in the bottom from rain that although you couldnt see it from the top, the roots goet all rotted. The planter sat in my garage over the winter. Last weekend, a friend drilled five holes in the bottom of the planter for me and I replanted this time with a large tomato plant. I will let everyone know how it goes. If I had the opportunity, I would have changed the rating of this to 1 or 2 stars for the aggravation and death of my rose bush. Never saw a planter that was set up like this before, really bad design. These are not cheap either, but honestly they are not worth the money at all."},

Ive been happy with the prefilled pods that are available, but my husband prefers his whole bean coffee. This allows him the convenience of using the Esperta with his own coffee. These work well in our machine. You do have to make sure you line up the little hole correctly when you insert it into the machine. The directions explain how fine or coarse the coffee needs to be for using it. It comes with a spoon and brush. We used to have a Tassimo machine and there were not any reusuable pods that worked with it, so I am pleased that we found these. Im excited to be able to use some nice flavored coffee beans. I love that these cut down on trash, too! Update 5212017  I am still using these and still like them. However, I did want to add something to my review. They dont come out of the pod holder very easily. I usually have to turn the holder upside down and tap it slightly to get it to come out. When doing that, that sometimes dislodges the little filter screen. I didnt realize that it had come out one time and I threw it in the trash with the coffee grounds. Now that I know that can happen, I make sure that its still there. And if it has come dislodged, I make sure to find it before I throw out the grounds. Its easy to put back in  it just snaps in place. I didnt realize it was even missing until I made coffee the next time with that pod and my coffee was full of grounds! Just wanted to share that."},

  {"id": 1922, "content": "A fun entry in the vampire  detective genre... | Vampires are all the rage on the small screen. Just look at recent entries ASINB000WFW12S Moonlight  The Complete Series, ASINB001FB4W0W True Blood The Complete First Season HBO Series, or the CWs The Vampire Diaries.  Blood Ties is a Canadian TV production that was filmed as a 22episode season. In the US, Lifetime TV decided to split was was actually one season into two, with the first eleven episodes Blood Price to Post Partum as Season One and the remaining eleven Norman to Deep Dark as Season Two. This box set collects all 22 episodes for the first time in North America the British box set that was released several years ago features all 22 episodes, but no extras. The TV budget doesnt allow topnotch special effects, but the show really works with what it has the set designs are great, but the CGI is largely lacking, and its strength is in the writing and performances.  Blood Ties revolves around Victoria Vicki Nelson, an excop with Torontos Metro police. Vicki was forced to resign due to a degenerative eye disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and is trying to make a living as a private investigator. Her fiery romance with fellow cop Mike Celluci is an onagain, offagain affair, and her first case as a PI gives her more than she bargained for someone is summoning demonic forces, and Henry Fitzroy, her new partner on the case, just happens to be a 480yearold vampire and is the illegitimate son of Henry VIII.  The series pilot Blood Price is faithfully based on Tanya Huffs ASIN0756405017 Blood Price BLOOD SERIES. The remainder of the season finds Vicki exploring demons, incubi, reanimated corpses, shapeshifters, mummies, voodoo, ghosts...while caught in a crackling love triangle between former flame Mike and sensual, deadly Henry Kyle Schmid beat out RPatz as sexiest vampire in a recent poll. Vickis new assistant is the perky Goth Coreen, who also has her eye on Henry.  Blood Ties consistently satisfies my cravings for an intelligently handled supernatural cop drama. Its premise sounds promising in print, but without Blood Ties cleverly crafted story arcs and meaningful character interaction, it would amount to little more than a tired monstermovieoftheweek retread. This is a show that wisely knows not to take itself too seriously, leading to fast and furious oneliners, visual gags and impeccable comedic timing. The entire Canadian cast and crew does a consistently amazing job of bringing Blood Ties to life, and its great to see a Canadian production receive airtime in the States.  The shows setting is Toronto but is filmed in Vancouver with exterior shots of identifying Toronto landmarks, but its still Canadian throughandthrough, a rarity in days where tired Toronto is expected to double as Everyamericancity. This may be the first show since ASINB0000C23T1 Forever Knight  The Trilogy, Part 1 1992  1993 and ASINB0017KP8Y0 Due South The Ultimate Collection  Three Complete Seasons that revels in its Canadianness.  Although Blood Ties is currently off the air, its fan base continues to spread through word of mouth, ASINB003DJULX6 Blood Ties hidden object game featuring characters, locations, and audio from the show, and Internet groups, thereby bringing new viewers into the fold. It has been at least a decade since I felt so strongly about a TV show I was so moved by Blood Ties strong female role model and intriguing blend of romance, police procedural, and the supernatural that I downloaded several episodes via iTunes and recruited several friends to the show.  Blood Ties remains my favorite postASINB0000C23T1 Forever Knight  The Trilogy, Part 1 1992  1993 for its enchanting blend of humor, passion, action, moral dilemmas, and the mortal and immortal ties that bind. Tanya Huffs source material has been toned down enough to allow families to enjoy Blood Ties together. Blood Ties protagonist Vicki Nelson Christina Cox is a strong positive role model for women through her physicality, selfreliance despite disability, and intelligence.  Its instantly obvious except to AmericanCanadian networks who were reluctant to pick up the show for a second season, grrr... why Blood Ties was nominated for numerous awards such as Constellation and Leo Awards. The entire cast, headed by Christina Cox Vicki, Kyle Schmid Henry, Dylan Neal Mike, and Gina Holden Coreen, has an outstanding chemistry that shines onscreen, and I cant wait to finally own the complete Blood Ties on DVD!"},

It turns out he put the rear legs in front and vice versa. Usually hes pretty good about putting things together and reading the manual first, but because this seemed so simple, he just decided to wing it. Once I pointed out that the legs were wrong, he quickly remedied it.The front legs have wheels on them so the chair can be moved and the rear legs are just wooden blocks. So it really was easy to assemble. The chair has some metal rivets along the outer side of the arms. The cushion is comfortable. The back is high enough for adequate support.

I also felt like I had to keep reapplying foot lotion to the soles of my feet while wearing the slippers because it got absorbed so quickly. The size of the slippers are fine. I wear a size 10W shoe and the XL is fine. It is easier to walk in these than it is the BBW ones.

I had never used one of gaiter face masks before I had more traditional paper or cloth wrap around the ears ones. I was actually pleasantly surprised how comfortable these are to wear and easy to pull up and down when you are in and out of locations where you need a mask. These are easy to put on, they do fit snugly which may or may not be a comfort issue for you. They are not very comfortable in a hot environment because these are not cotton based I live in Florida and they are hot when being worn outside. However, when shopping, these are great. Not sure how resistant they are to the virus, I typically will wear a filter or even a tissue on the inside when I am going into a crowded area for extra protection. These are cute and colorful and definitely a conversation starter."},
  {"id": 1969, "content": "bamboo recipe box | This recipe box appears to bamboo has two small hinges on the back.. the box opens fully so you can easily insert or remove cards.  I have provided TWO PICS  we shall see if the amazon photo trolls allow them...4x6 cards fit in with about 1434 on the side that is free once inserted.  It comes with a minimal divider set and a plastic insert to hold a recipe card out and visible using the slot on the top.  There is a film on the plastic insert piece you will want to remove before using.  There is also a tiny magnet on the the front  and top of the box.  It sort of keeps the box closed... but I dont think its of huge use.  The foot print of the box is approx 5x7 or so  just eye balling it.  The lid fits perfectly down on the base when closed.  I noticed a few reviewers have had issues with corners and such. No such issue on mine  but production lines miss on occasion.  I THINK its real bamboo... feels like it.  The bottom notes that it was 34Designed in the USA  Made in China.34  In case that matters to you.  I would certainly prefer MADE in the USA. The nice thing about bamboo is that it is totally renewable.  I think its pretty sturdy.  It has a weight to it that is not unreasonable, but its not a lightweight to grab and move it  although its not super easy to grab either in case that is an issue.  I find it easier to open the box and grab it while opened to move it. I dont use recipes a lot so that is ok for me. It will sit in a drawer.  I mostly use it for 34inspiration34 and an occasional reminder of an ingredient.  All in all, I think its a fair price and a good box.

This is a no chemical, steam clean.  I would let a baby play on my floor after using this, but not after using a string, sponge or a swiffer mop. They just dont clean good enough. If you have a tough spot, just let the steamer sit on it for a few seconds. Itll clean up all of the goo.  I recommend buying extra cleaning cloths so you can just change them out as they get dirty.

  {"id": 2005, "content": "Cooking from the heart Gujaratistyle | Prashad is an Indian vegetarian restaurant in West Yorkshire that was named Best Restaurant by no less than Gordon Ramsay. The word Prashad means sacred offering and refers to religious food offerings left at temples. Amazon happened to recommend Prashad to me as I was looking at other UKauthored vegetarian cookbooks. I was instantly intrigued, as I am quite familiar with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern vegetarian cuisine, but Indian cuisine is relatively unknown to me other than some Indian restaurant standards like tikka masala and saag paneer. Ive been vegetarian for over ten years and am always on the lookout for new dishes to add to my repertoire, and Prashad opened my eyes and my spice cupboard! to the myriad of flavors and textures in Gujarati cuisine and introduced me to new ways of cooking that will make it into my regular rotation, particularly how to make masalas and tarkas heating spices in hot oil. Gujarati cuisine is also very vegetarianfriendly as it is strongly influenced by Jain vegetarianism and traditional Hinduism.  I reached out to Prashad through Facebook and the restaurant was kind enough to send out an autographed review copy from the UK. The book is written by matriarch Kaushy her son Bobby is the current owner and manager of the restaurant. Kaushys four simple rules fresh and fantastic, prepare, relax, and cook with love and clear instructions make this flavorful vegetarian cuisine accessible to any level of cook. As many of the cooking utensils and ingredients were new to me, I particularly appreciated the illustrated guide to ingredients and utensils and the several pages of practical points, top tips and how to roasting seeds, stopping eggplant from oxidizing, stopping dhal from foaming over, preventing tarka spices from burning, balancing spicy foods, etc. Sharing extra food with friends and neighbors vakti vevar is also an important step to creating community bonds in Gujarati culture. The several sample menus in the back will allow you to create an authentic Gujarati feast for family and friends with plenty to share!  As this is a UK cookbook, recipes are in metric  temperatures in Celsius, but as I frequently cook using metric, this is no issue as long as you have a good kitchen scale. Many of the starters  appetizers are fried, but Kaushy also provides instructions for baking them for a lowerfat alternative, which I greatly appreciated as I try to avoid fried foods. You will also find variations that will add extra mileage, and serving suggestions on what to pair each recipe with I liked that the page numbers were provided for quick reference and tabbed those so I could quickly flip back and forth between the two. Beautiful fullcolor photos on matte paper and colorful illustrations of elephants and geometric prints give a muchneeded splash of color and makes the pages pop. At the back of the book is a guide of Kaushys suggested brands, although most may only be available in the UK or online the only commercial brand I saw near me was Deep. The clear stepbystep instructions with helpful visual and auditory cues when the mustard seeds begin to pop, turn the heat to low make you feel as though Kaushy is standing next to you guiding you  Kaushy also gives cooking classes at The Cooking School at Dean Clough Mills, which I would love to attend.  I also loved the sample menus for special occasion feasts, weekend dinner party, and three sample quick midweek suppers. This section is particularly wellsuited for new cooks, as Kaushy gives timing instructions for each step of the dinner so all the dishes are ready at the same time. This is extremely helpful and something which is frequently left out of other cookbooks.  The most difficult challenge will undoubtedly be finding the fresh Indian vegetables, pulses, and specialty flour blends locally even with an Indian and Middle Eastern grocery store at my disposal, I was unable to source some of the more exotic ingredients like colocasia leaves, hyacinth beans,  and bottle gourd, but found enough staples to make several of the dishes that caught my eye, including the pethis garliccoconut filled potato balls, handvo seed topped lentil cake, paneer tikka with homemade paneer that I added curry powder to from ASIN0761177485 OneHour Cheese Ricotta, Mozzarella, Chvre, PaneerEven Burrata. Fresh and Simple Cheeses You Can Make in an Hour or Less!, ferar bataka gingerchili peanuts and potatoes, and chole. Some of the dishes like chole come together quickly, while others like the handvo require time for prep the dough must ferment at least 12 hours. There is also a chapter on rice dishes and breads that includes many Gujarati staples such as rotli, bhakri, juvar na rotla, paratha, puri and bathura.  I have a notorious sweet tooth and am quite familiar with Middle Eastern desserts like baklava and basbousa and some Indian desserts like gulab jamun, but loved the carrot pudding, dhud pak cardamom, almond and pistachio rice pudding and mava lapsi spiced fruit, nut, and cracked wheat pudding, which reminded me of the Ukrainian kutya from Prashad. I enjoyed trying out some of the accompanying dishes like imli chutney tamarind is easy to find in my town both fresh and dried, and I loved the tangy sweetsourspicy kick this gave to dishes. I am particularly fond of chutneys and pickles, which had always intimidated me before I will admit to buying commercial chutney, which always seemed lacking or too sweet. I cant wait to try the murabho cinnamon and cardamominfused sweet mango pickle as mangoes are plentiful in my city I use piloncillo in place of jaggery as it is much easier to come by in my neck of the woods.  Pleasing to the eyes and stomach, Prashad opened up a whole new world of flavors and cooking techniques from Gujarati cuisine a second Prashad cookbook is currently in the works, and based on the fabulous recipes and cultural tidbits in the first book, it will be on my mustbuy list!  Thank you to Kaushy, Bobby, and the Prashad staff for the review copy and I hope to visit you in Drighlington one day!"},

That is a huge difference. Every other reading was inaccurate, as well, and far, far off the mark.  Worse, I tried a few more tests with these strips over the next two weeks just to see, and realized every single time I took it, it was giving the exact same reading with only a minor change in nitrites twice.. Out of over ten readings. Every single reading was the same  but not for the fish shop readings which have changed PH issues fixed now.  Therefore, from my experience with these strips, I have to say that I honestly believe that they are faulty and I would never recommend them to anyone."},

  {"id": 2041, "content": "mesh washable drawstring bags | I purchased these to hold toys in my my grandsons toy chest.  The work GREAT.  First, because they are slightly see through they can see whats in each one.  My four year old is able to open them on his own.  The seven year old likes that everything has its place  he likes organization.  The draw strings have a tab with push button that keeps them closed or you can keep them loosely closed by just pulling the drawstrings.  Comes with 3 sizes.  The largest have a blue cloth strip on the top... the next size down have green strips and the smallest have red strips.  The sizes given are accurate.  I cannot speak to the effectiveness of using as produce bags, however, they make AWESOME toy bags.  From Lincoln logs to match box cars, they are perfect.  I also like that I can wash them as needed.  I always update my reviews if new info would be useful."},

I am hoping it lasts longer that the so called quotpolishquot that was original to the rocks I mean, I paid extra for the quotpolishedquot rocks! sigh  In the mean time this was very easy to apply.  I got the hose out... rinsed the rocks all off and allowed them to dry.  Used a blower to get rid of extra dust and pine needles from neighbors pine tree and sprayed evenly.  Solidly dry in 30 minutes.  Really happy with the results. Even though this probably not the usual application!"},

I used it about once a week. After the first use I was able to 34file34 off the cracks that had developed. I will say that while my heels are not 34baby softsmooth34 they are certainly are smoother than they were and I dont have any cracks. I have not had to replace the file yet, but I purchased back ups.  Of all the crazy things I have tried in the past, razors, cheese graters, pumice stones by the dozens and even a 200 clarin which was WORTHLESS and I was SO angry at paying 200 for it!!... this is the first thing that has actually worked.  And its easy, convenient and painless.  Easy does it... a little bit at time.  After the very first use you will see a marked difference.  So far, so good.  If there are any issues I will update this review.  If youve been thinking about this file, I would say dont be afraid... give it a try. Its a few bucks, not hundreds so its fairly price painless too."},

  {"id": 2064, "content": "Good interviews, but ultimately a campaign ad | I watched both Agenda and Agenda 2.  The best information comes from those interviewed in each of these documentaries.  They discuss the deception, disinformation, and manipulation of society by government and corporate interests.  However where this fails is its conclusion of whos behind it and what the solution is.  Mr. Bowers claims that a return to Christian values and the traditional Republican Party of the Reagan Era will fix things.  Well it wont.  Scapegoat labels like Liberal, Progressive, Farleft, Communist offer convenient bad guys for those responsible.  But its the good cop, bad cop interplay between and across both Democratic and Republican administrations over the decades that have gotten us into the state that were in today.  Its the establishment that produces the candidates and the policies and the longagenda which is to blame.  And unfortunately Mr. Bowers is just kicking the same ole bucket further down the road by cozying up to and being promoted from within by that same establishment.  In summary, Agenda and Agenda 2 are akin to a football team that successfully covers 99 yards but then fails to score by describing the problem well but then asserting exactly the wrong action plan ad the remedy in its conclusion."},

  {"id": 2067, "content": "A good introduction to Spanish history for younger readers. | I am a huge fan of YA historical fiction, especially international historical fiction. Having lived in the lands that Isabel once ruled Castilla y Len, the novel was a pleasant reminder of the many castles, monasteries and medieval buildings I visited while living in northern Spain Burgos. When I attended the Universidad de Burgos I took Spanish history as a requirement, and we learned about many of the events covered in this novel the Moorish conquest in 711, the centuries of the Reconquista the attempt to retake Spain and drive out the infidels, the final victory at Granada in January 1492, the later expulsion of Jews and Moors that year, and most fateful, Cristobl Colons discovery of America, as well as the political intrigue surrounding Alfonso and Enrique, Juana La Beltraneja, and later Juana La Loca. Isabel strives to follow the instruction of her confessor later the head of the brutal Spanish Inquisition Toms de Torquemada, but is spirited, not content with the answers she is given. With her father dead and her mother having lost her senses, Isabel is left to fend for herself and to follow her heart. Isabels diary reads like exactly that a diary, with long stretches of time glossed over, full of the tedious details that filled her confined life until her marriage. The extended cast of characters numbers near forty, and at times the book feels like a memory exercise. However, the author makes a brave attempt to bring to life a lost period of time when Spain was divided between Christian and Moor, and the Christian provinces were dangerous, full of outlaws and warring factions, each ruled by a separate king. Isabels life is constantly at risk, caught in a war between her brothers, and it is her marriage to Fernando of Aragn that finally produces the beginnings of a unified Espaa. Although some information is inaccurate, Isabel Jewel of Castilla is full of historical details about life in Spain, the political climate of the time, popular beliefs, court life and more, and various Spanish namesphrases are used there is a handy glossary in the back. There is an abridged family tree, photocopies of maps, engravings and statues, and a list of characters provided at the end of the book."},

I recently had to change bra sizing because both my shoulders and my boobs grew a little bit not sure why but in the end I had to change sizes because the previous ones were just too tight for me now unfitting. I found this sizing to be best and now I can finally feel comfortable wearing bras again but definitely love this brand in fact and the only reason I bought multiples of these is because I really struggle finding bras that actually fit me well because of my size and chest size most of them are just too tight either on the actual bra area or the chest area itself so usually they are not comfortable for me. These ones are perfect and honestly a lot more natural feeling around the chest as well not super tight like usual which I appreciate."},
  {"id": 2072, "content": "The BigWood Boards cutting board I received is a 9 ... | The BigWood Boards cutting board I received is a 9 x 12 light maple with a custom carved monogram. This handsome board includes scalloped handles and a  trough around the perimeter of the board.  There are several features on this board that I truly appreciate. The board is solid maple with sure grip rubber feet, no slipping when you are trying to arrange food items.  The scalloped handles are cast aluminum,  a very elegant look when used as a serving tray. The juice groove catches liquid, keeps the mess off the table.  What I most appreciate is the fact that this item was hand finished and made in the United States. The only negative I could call out on this board is the rather rough finish on the top the bottom, on the other hand, is smooth to the touch.  Because this is wood, this item does require special care.  Per instructions received with the board, it can be cleaned with soapy warm water but should not be used in a dishwasher or immersed in water.  Oil should be used when the surface appears faded or dried out.  I see this as an appetizer server because of the smaller size.  However, BWB offers a variety of sizes and a choice of maple and walnut food for their products.  A monogrammed cutting board would make a thoughtful unique wedding, anniversary or housewarming gift."},

I have always struggled removing the shredding heads and have nearly dropped one a few times.  The handle only requires one hand lets you get a good grip on it and makes it so easy.  Shredders are noisy in general, but this one is reasonably quiet.  It has the added feature of a slot for CDDVD shredding and you can also shred plastic credit cards.  I didnt try shredding 12 sheets that it is supposed to handle.  I noticed that most shredders work a lot better if you dont try to use them at full capacity.  This does seem powerful enough to do 12 pages at once, if you want to do that.  Amazingly this comes with a complete 12 page manual, explaining the features of the shredder, maintenance, trouble shooting and warnings. There is also a separate one page troubleshooting guide.  These days manuals are a rarity, so I think that is a real plus.  Well designed machine.  So whats not to like?  Even though this is a crosscut shredder the pieces are a little bigger than with my prior shredder. It still does an adequate job of shredding, but would have liked to see smaller pieces.  Also, the waste bin is a little small and will require emptying more often than my previous shredder that has a much larger bin.  Overall, this is a great medium duty shredder and I like it a lot."},

  {"id": 2096, "content": "A bit slow at first, but ultimately rewarding | I selected The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry to read and review because I loved Major Pettigrews Last Stand, a book to which it was compared in the publishers preview.  And while I prefer Major Pettigrew for its pacing and multicultural appeal, I wholeheartedly recommend Harold Fry.  It has charms of its own.  Henry David Thoreau observed, The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation, and I could not help but recall this quotation as I began Rachel Joyces lovely debut novel.  As the novel begins, Harold is merely existing.  The reader is not given many details, but it is clear that Harolds marriage to Maureen is an empty shell, and that there are problems in his relationship with his adult son, David.  Then Harold gets a farewell letter of sorts from a friend, Queenie Hennessy,  and his carefully orchestrated charade of a life begins to come apart.  Queenie had done something nice for Harold twenty years previous, and he always regretted not thanking her.  Whatever this is is shrouded in mystery, and many readers will suspect a longpast affair.  All these questions are a bit disconcerting, but if the reader is patient, all will be resolved.  Harold writes a pro forma response to Queenies note, but as he goes out to mail it, something prevents him from putting it in the first mailbox he comes to.  He passes postbox after postbox, and eventually makes an impulsive decision to walk from his hometown to Queenies hospice, about 600 miles.  Thus begins his transformation from a kind of living death to fullness of life.  Readers who are familiar with Joseph Campbells The Heros Journey will immediately recognize the motif  the hero leaves the world he knows to embark on a quest.  Along the way he meets both helpers and tempters, and he eventually returns to the known world with a fullness of knowledge or with something to enrich his community and himself.  Harold Fry fits this motif to a tee.  He meets many people and even animals along the way, and he gains something of value from each of them, even those who would deter him from his quest.  Meanwhile, back at home, Maureen is undergoing her own transformation as she worries and responds to Harolds calls, postcards, and gifts.  Nothing is as Harold or Maureen expect it to be.  And the end of the quest is rewarding, but not in the way Harold imagines.  One final observation  This is a beautifully written novel.  Most readers will love the use of language, especially in descriptions of the natural world.  I am stunned that this is the authors first novel, though she has written many screenplays for the BBC.  I hope to read much more of her work.  Most readers will like and appreciate Harold Fry if they persevere through the ambiguity at the beginning.  Everything falls together eventually, I promise!  Highly recommended."},

  {"id": 2119, "content": "User Friendly Keyboard | I purchased a cheap, no name brand keyboard for my teenager a year ago. It was not a good quality keyboard at all. She disliked it so much, she rarely played it. I got her a nice Yamaha one which was much better. It was also a higher price. My son wanted to play around with a keyboard to create MIDI sounds for his video games and my teens werent thrilled about sharing a keyboard, so I got him this Casio instrument.  I would say that this Casio one is a nice middle ground keyboard. Its better than the cheap no name one Its completely adequate for a beginning teenager or child who wants to learn or play around with a keyboard. He did have to purchase a specialized cable to hook it up to his laptop, but that was expected. The keys sound a little plastic sounding, but not as bad as the first keyboard I got. The plastic sounds are pretty standard for portable keyboards in my opinion.  This keyboard has been fairly user friendly. It was easy to set up. For the price, it does a good job. When my son played with the cheap one, he expressed his desire for a better keyboard. With this one, hes satisfied with its performance for his needs."},

  {"id": 2127, "content": "A sweeping tale of diverging fates | In  Frances de Pontes Peebles The Seamstress, two sisters from rural Brazil hold the key to important events that are shaping the country in the late 1920smid 1930s. Raised by their widowed Aunt Sofia after their mother died in childbirth and their drunken father abandoned them, the girls have completely opposite views on what is important in life. Emilia favors immersing herself in glamorous Fon Fon magazines, imagining that shes an important lady in a big city she experiments with curling and cutting her hair in the latest fashion, and her hope is to snag a beau that will take her away and into the pampered life of the city complete with a tiled kitchen and indoor plumbing. Luiza is maimed from a childhood accident that immobilized her arm at the elbow she grows to be very tall and increasingly bitter, and the villagers steer clear of her as she goes on long predawn walks.  But her heart is just she secretly frees the captured songbirds that the villagers insist on keeping. Both girls are talented seamstresses, although their talents lie in different areas.  Their lives are changed irrevocably when Hawk, a local cangaceiro, or outlaw, and his gang invade their remote mountain town. The girls and their aunt are forced to make uniforms for the unwashed, violent men, and their leader Hawk takes a fancy to Luiza, abducting her into the wild, lawless scrublands.  The cangaceiros rebelled against private land owners and government taxes, and became romanticized bandits in the lawless, arid scrublands.  Emilia is left behind, and when her plan to elope with her sewing teacher fizzles, she quickly finds a man to marry that can carry her out of the abject poverty. She carries a small picture of Luiza with her and collects newspaper clippings about Luizas success in the cangaceiro gang, where shes called The Seamstress.  Trapped in a loveless marriage with a gay socialite, Emilia is taunted by the maids and ridiculed by her motherinlaw about her backwards country manners even as she is chastised for not producing a grandchild.  The novel is told in alternating chapters by Emilia and Luiza as we follow them through a changing Brazil demonstrations,  political unrest, revolution, the fierce countryside colonels who either buy their titles or take it by force the outside world intrudes in the form of the stock market crash of 29, yet the sisters lives are still connected by invisible threads that bind their early memories together, of the shared poverty, their aunts saints closet where they desperately prayed for love and other deliverances, and finding refuge in each other. Both Emilia and Luiza are forced to adapt to alien ways of life for Emilia, this means being ignored sexually and otherwise by her husband, who married her in an attempt to pacify his demanding parents about his obvious homosexuality, and she is forced to be constantly belittled by her inlaws and the maids. For Luiza, it means learning how to live with little water, how to identify various sounds as friend or foe, how to use a gun, and how to look death in the eye during raids and skirmishes.  Peebles brings the sights and sounds of Brazil to vivid life, from the dry, arid scrublands to the humid coastal town of Recife, describing the native plants and animals in detail, and makes effective use of Luiza and Emilia to represent the vast contrasts between povertystricken rural Brazil and its more affluent coastal cities during the early 20th century.  The Seamstress is a gripping read that chronicles both important historical changes unfolding within Brazil, and the deepseated bonds between two sisters separated by fate."},

SSD solid state is the only way to go these days and I think that in a very short time the mechanical hard drives with spinning platters will be a thing of the past.  Of course being solid state, it is completely silent and it produces almost no heat at all.  It is not unlike a USB stick, except that it has a short cord that it needs to plug in.  The cord is a bit short around 16 inches, which is my only gripe with this product.  Being that it is advertised as portable, you wouldnt want to carry around a long cord with it anyway, so that could be an advantage.  The unit is very small about the size of 2 USB sticks.  I acquired an SSD drive of the same capacity 500 GB a couple years back and it is twice the physical size of this unit.  Technological advances have steadily decreased the sizes of storage while increasing the capacity.  This has 3 included files for enabling security on the device one for Windows and one for MAC.  The third file is for Android devices and it is just a text file with a link where you can apparently get what you need.  Great little device.

My niece said it looked like we had gotten stung by bees all over our faces! There isnt any noticeable scent to it. The bubbles or foam stayed on the mask and wasnt dripping all over us. I have sensitive skin and the mask didnt irritate me at all. When we were finished, I did feel the need to rinse off my face. Some sheet masks say to just rub in whatever is left, but this was slightly sticky. Overall, this was fun!"},

  {"id": 2185, "content": "A fun, sassy read | Francesca Cesca Marinelli is a tour guide with a ghost tour company in St. Augustine. In her spare time, she loves allnight shopping at WalMart, learning how to salsa and surf, and studying design. So far, so good, right? Except for the fact that Cescas a vampire who hates the smell of blood it literally makes her sick, goes out during the daytime if the suns not too strong, doesnt use her vamp powers, and shes on the prowl for Mr. Right. After being buried for most of her undead life, shes determined to live her life to the fullest. As a vampire, shes required to wear a tracking chip and to have a human sponsor, but other than these small inconveniences, her life is pretty normal. Like Charlaine Harriss Southern Vampire novels, there is a violent antivampire group, the Covenant, that seeks to find and destroy vamps.  Cesca is a refreshing narrator a psychic, her takenoprisoners attitude is tested when shes involved in a murder investigation special investigator Deke Saber rubs her the wrong way. Cescas never been romantically involved, and Deke starts to get on her nerves in other ways that she didnt expect. Cesca starts to resent all the happy couples that surround her and fears that shell be single forever, but fate has other plans.  Things get weirder for Cesca as the same tourists appear for repeat ghost tours and yes, ghosts do make appearances, and a mysterious magical cat follows her around. As the evidence piles up, so does the danger facing Cesca and her friends. There was enough suspense without being overly gory, and enough twists and turns that I was left guessing until the end. A fun, fastpaced blend of romance, suspense, and magic, La Vida Vampire was a rockin read and I cant wait for more of Cescas adventures in ASIN0425227545 Last Vampire Standing."},

This one is really mediocre at best in my personal opinion  and everyone is entitled to their own. NO pictures.

The recipes flow over several page turns... it would be better if this book at a spiral back so you could easily turn the pages. Another thing I didnt like is that various font sizes... super tiny to really big... so odd.

  {"id": 2199, "content": "A good case and good value | There were no reviews for this case but I took a chance and bought it and Im glad I did.  Its light and yet so solid that I tested it  I weigh 170 lbs. and I stood on the empty case.  It was fine.  Its a hard plastic shell with an aluminum interlocking edge that goes all the way around where the lid meets the body.  There are metal hinges on one side and three metal buckles on the other.  Inside it has a plush black lining that fits a Telecaster well, with no moving around when the case is closed.  Theres a one foot long groove inside that supports the guitars neck, instead of some cases where the neck rests on one narrow point.  It has feet on the side and bottom, and will stand on end too, though not perfectly straight.  On the negative side, on mine two of the buckles required a small adjustment to get them to close firmly into place without rattling.  The handle is plain hard plastic.  And the two small storage areas on either side of the neck dont have lids, but they do seal shut when the case is closed.  I had ordered a 50 Musicians Gear electric guitar case from Musicians Friend, but it arrived damaged and it was flimsy so I sent it back.  This is built way better and looks nicer too.  For some reason Amazon only has one photo of this online but if you search there are more pics on other sites.  EDIT After about three years of use one of the feet popped out while the case was being transported in the front seat of my car. Then two years after that another one of the feet came off, so now its down to 2 out of 4. So it doesnt stand up well any more but its a good case otherwise."},

This particular flavor Flatland Feast with Turkey, Quail  Duck they didnt seem to be as enthusiastic about as others, but they will eat it in time.  They always have canned wet food too and they always eat that before a kibble type of food anyway.  This is grain free and says it has no artificial preservatives, colors or flavors, no corn, wheat or soy and no chickenpoultry byproduct meals.  Thats all good.  I did notice that this food does have quite a number of ingredients however, most of them are either meat, fruit, vegetables or vitamins.  A few of the ingredients I didnt recognize.  The only 34bad34 ingredient that I found was salt, but doesnt look like there is much.  I did not see any kind of sugar or sweetener which you can find in some dog foods.  Yes, dogs like sugar too and that is bad for them, just like for us.

It says it is 34made for34 the company, which is based in Connecticut.  Have never heard of any problem with this companies products, so I think you are very safe using them.

  {"id": 2215, "content": "Familyfriendly faithful adaptation of Esther Forbes classic as good as I remember from childhood! | As a child, I would go to Colonial Williamsburg nearly every year on school breaks. I adored anything having to do with colonial history, and fell in love with Johnny Tremain book first, then movie instantly. Esther Forbes classic novel tells the rousing tale of a haughty Boston silversmiths apprentice, Johnny Tremain, who, when maimed in an accident with molten silver, gives up his apprenticeship, hits all new lows as he is turned down for jobs because of his deformed hand, and is accused of theft by one of Bostons elite. He matures from boy to man as he joins up with the Sons of Liberty and participates in the planning of the American Revolution along with some of colonial Bostons most brilliant minds.  Disneys 1957 film adaptation starring Hal Stalmaster was made for TV but also shown in theaters. The costumes, music, and sets are fairly convincing at portraying colonial Boston. The film, at 81 minutes, cuts out a lot of backstory regarding Johnnys inner process of maturation and changes a crucial plot point near the end presumably to make the film more childfriendly, but generally remains faithful to the spirit of the original book. The transfer is generally very clean and crisp, amazing for a movie of this age.  Amazingly, we actually saw an old reel copy of Johnny Tremain in my fifth grade class  this was in the early 1990s, and until now, the only copy I owned was a disintegrating VHS tape thatd Id recorded from the Disney Channel. The DVD release features wonderful extras Walt Disney talking about the making of the film, and the introductions that were played with each part the original film was divided into two episodes, basically shameless marketing for other Disney films and a Liberty Square theme park experiment that never came to fruition, but fascinating nonetheless that these extras were saved and presented with the film. The only disappointment is that the excellent animated short Ben and Me, about a mouse who shares a home with Benjamin Franklin, wasnt included its referenced in the two segments, but has never been released to DVD.  A great little family film for history buffs and a real treat those who grew up on classic 1950s Disney liveaction fare Swamp Fox, Spin and Marty, Davy Crockett."},

  {"id": 2220, "content": "Wonderful Performances Slightly Boring Overall | The performances in this movie are all 5star.  I knocked off one star on my overall review, because the movie just wasnt quite as entertaining as I thought it could have been.  Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood and does a wonderful job in the role, but Martin Landau stole the show with his portrayal of Bela Lugosi.  You forget you are watching Landau and actually start believing you are seeing Lugosi.  The movie is shot in black  white, which I thought would be a big downer, but it didnt detract from the movie in the least.  I forgot I was watching a black  white movie.  Ed Wood struggles and struggles and you keep hoping he will make it big, but you know in the back of your mind that he is never going to.  A lot of people will probably pass up this movie because its not a big exciting extravaganza.  Its not really inspirational.  Its not funny, other than a couple of light moments.  In many ways I would say that it is a wonderful tribute to a man who never gave up on his dream.  His persistence and his lack of ability to never make a really good movie has earned him a unique place in movie history.  Perhaps not the way he wanted to be remembered, but he is remembered and maybe in the end thats all anyone can really hope for."},

I also have a large collection of Christmas CDs, including Celtic, Polish, and standards, so when I finally got my hands on a copy of Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas, I was thrilled.  Containing eighteen tracks including several alternate takes, youll find swinging covers of Jingle Bells, Sleigh Ride, Frosty, and Let It Snow!, along with some surprising choices such as Good Morning Blues and an upbeat Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. Ellas tight phrasing and genius timing make these old standards swing, but she also shows a sultrier side on What Are You Doing New Years Eve. Christmas Island is a fun Andrew Sisters  Der Bingle jingle that hearkens back to WWII.  Ella uses her indomitable sense of playfulness to rejuvenate some potentially tired Christmas classics nowhere is this more evident than on an alternate take of Frosty, where she adopts a littlegirl pout complete with lisp. It was cute for one listen, but I found myself skipping over it on subsequent plays. Another fact that was a bit jarring was that the alternate tracks were not from the same sessions as the album tracks they were recorded with a different orchestra as well. But the remastered sound quality is impeccable, and Ellas never sounded better. An extensive liner note essay by Will Friedwald only sweetens the deal."},
  {"id": 2240, "content": "Looks great, but lacks some basic features that less expensive models have. | I am fairly new to the world of slow cooking I purchased my firstever slow cooker, a ASINB005GZ2OBW Hamilton Beach Stovetop Slow Cooker  Blacksilver 6 Quart, about a year ago and have been slow cooking several times a week ever since I have several slow cooker cookbooks that I rely on constantly, including ASIN054700303X The Italian Slow Cooker, ASIN0547744455 The Mediterranean Slow Cooker, and ASIN1936493578 Slow Cooker Revolution Volume 2. I use my slow cooker regularly to make all manner of desserts cakes, cheesecakes, bread puddings, soups, and entrees.  This AllClad slow cooker was the first AllClad appliance that I have used I also own several madeintheUSA AllClad pans that I use regularly and swear by.  First and foremost, I am not thrilled that it is made in China. Its obvious that the quality control isnt up to the same standards as their USmade cookware the heavy ceramic insert has numerous tiny bubbles  holes, is rough on the bottom where the insert is not glazed, and the lid does not fit the insert snugly nor is there a latch  locking mechanism or hole for a thermometertemperature probe. The unit LOOKS impressive on the counter, although it is absolutely massive it weighs close to 20 pounds with the insert in.  On to setting the cooking mode and time you are limited to 28? hours on high or 420 hours on low, at which point the slow cooker will automatically switch to warm mode. This is first unit Ive had with a programmable timer, but I did like the solid feel of the buttons. The cooking time limits seemed kind of arbitrary it seemed strange that I could only program the unit on high for a maximum of eight hours, but up to 20 hours on low.  I used the AllClad slow cooker to make several dishes, including a Greek shrimp and tomato dish. I went according to the time in the recipe so as not to keep removing the lid it recommended cooking the shrimp 10 minutes on high they were VERY overcooked, whereas in my Hamilton Beach, I had to cook them for a few extra minutes.  Naturally, I was apprehensive after reading the hundreds of onestar reviews about the ceramic insert cracking and breaking, or the electronics would suddenly stop working. I have not experienced either of these yet, but I was very careful to handwash the insert even though the manual claims that both the insert and lid are dishwashersafe, Im not chancing it. During cooking on high, I did notice several very loud popping sounds coming from the insert that were audible from two rooms away I was sure that the insert would be cracked, but could find no hairline cracks after washing and drying the insert I waited until the insert was completely cool before washing. I have a feeling based on so many others experiences that the insert will be the first thing to fail luckily there is a oneyear warranty, which I registered for immediately, and I plan to continue using this as my primary slow cooker.  Bottom line it does what a slow cooker is supposed to do, but for this price, I expect a solid, flawless appliance that will stand up to several years of frequent useabuse, an insert that does not crack, and responsive customer service.  The good  I liked that there is a rubber seal  gasket that the ceramic insert rests on as it is so heavy, it makes moving the slow cooker and removing the insert much more manageable.  It does come with a small collection of starter recipes, including Asian Beef Stew, Mahogany Glazed Pork Loin, Peach Melba Bread Pudding, Chicken with Mushrooms in White Wine Sauce, and Tunisian Spiced Turkey Breas with Root Vegetables.  The bad  Even on low, the temperature seems to run hot  Finishing on the ceramic insert small imperfections in the ceramic insert that can lead to cracking  Ifwhen the insert cracks and it seems to happen quite frequently based on reviews, expect to spend a good 75 on a replacement if your unit is no longer under warranty"},

Unfortunately most long cables tend to take up a lot of space.  This flat cable is much more compact.  The flat design makes it nice to place up against a wall and there are included mounting clips for a wall or baseboard, that have a small nail that you just hammer in.  I dont know what the maximum length limit is for Ethernet.  I suspect that after a certain length, speed might be impacted, but I didnt see any degradation in speed or performance with this over 65 foot long cable.  I am very satisfied with this and while I dont quite yet need a cable this long, I may some day.  If you dont need the full length, it is very easy to coil up a portion of the cable easier than round cables.  I like it and would buy this again if I should need another."},

The Spanish novel is every bit as compelling and graceful as its English counterpart, and great care is taken not to change any of the details.

  {"id": 2264, "content": "Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake a spooky tale of dogs,gold, greed | Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is the seventh Nancy Drew game from Her Interactive. This time around Nancy is visiting family friend Sally McDonald at her new cabin in Ghost Lake, Pennsylvania, once home to notorious 1920s gangster Mickey Mallone. Sally has fled in fear, and when Nancy arrives she finds herself trapped at the cabin due to a fallen tree. Sally hurriedly calls her from her cell phone, warning her about the ghost dogs. Soon after, Nancy sees them for herself four snarling, lunging Rottweilers with glowing teeth and eyes attack the cabin, rattling the doors and throwing themselves at the house. Nancy decides to stay and get to the bottom of her latest mystery ghost dogs or fleshandblood ones? There are three suspects Emily Griffen, owner of Ems Emporium Moon Lakes general store, Jeff Akers, park ranger, and Red Knott, retired birdwatcher. All three have some direct connection to the reason behind the hauntings, and the main motive is the rumoured cache of stolen gold that Mickey Mallone stashed somewhere near the cabin before being hauled off to jail where he died. Nancy must navigate through a maze of woods to find the cemetery behind the cabin in order to search for clues, as well as interrogating suspects, snooping through secret passageways, and escaping danger. As in all Nancy Drew games, Nancy can die in a number of ways if shes not careful. This time possible deaths include a motorboat explosion, falling through rotten floorboards, falling down a hole in the dark, being clubbed with a human bone, being tied up and left in a burning shed, and being drowned, so be careful and save often! GDoML features beautiful graphics of various locations to explore Mallones cabin, the woods, several locations on Moon Lake, a cemetery, an underground network of passageways, and a speakeasy. Playing as a Senior Detective, I found that the difficulty level was just about right, however, the woods maze drove me crazy and I had to go online to print off a decent map the one included in the game didnt help me much. That was by far the most challenging part of the game, since Nancy has to go into the woods a number of times to search for clues, birds, bugs and more. Every screenshot looked the same, and the map had to be brought up each time, with no way to mark Nancys progress onscreen. One nifty feature was Nancys PDA, which automatically records clues, phone numbers, and hints. You can also call Sally, a mystery woman connected to the case, and George and Bess if you need clues. Most of the puzzles were of two types numericdialsswitches or tasks. There are several dial puzzles, a letter block puzzle, a valve puzzle, and a safe combination to crack. The other three characters will assign Nancy tasks in return for necessary items such as batteries, camouflage gear, sandpaper and a spark plug, including stacking cola cans, finding bait in the woods, taking pictures of birds with a digital camera, and organizing file folders by Roman numerals. Nancy also performs tasks for Sally, such as testing the well water and repairing rotten floorboards. The puzzles in this game seem much more natural and integrated into the gaming environment than in some previous Nancy Drew games. As with previous Nancy Drew games, there is an alarm clock setting to change from day to night since some tasks and events can only be completed then. Graphics were above average and voice work and sounds were above average as well. The ambient nature sounds were very well done the forest sounds different between day and night, insects droning, individual bird calls, creaking wooden doors and stairs, the ghost dogs. The music was not memorable other than building tension in certain key scenes. The interface is simple all actions are accomplished with the left mouse button. You can pan around some screens, making it closer to 360 rather than a static environment, but overall the Nancy Drew games are still in a slideshow format. One improvement is characters in earlier games characters would only have one or two movements and repeat them while talking to Nancy, and the lipsynching was really bad. In GDoML, at least one character moves very articulately and randomly and characters lip synch much more realistically. The attention to detail makes this game educational as well as fun in the ranger station there is a computer with files on local wildlife, park regulations, and the history of Moon Lake. Nancy will do a good deal of reading old newspaper clippings and journals. Nearly everything is subtitled for hearingimpaired players a very nice touch, including sounds, dialogue and cutscenes. One last feature that I appreciated was the short promos for the other six Nancy Drew games in the series and a trailer for the next Nancy Drew game The Haunted Carousel. Overall this is a nice introduction to the Nancy Drew series from Her Interactive and a fun mystery to solve with plenty of details and creepy moments. Good luck and happy sleuthing!"},

It can be put on the left or right side depending on which of your hands is dominant. Theres also a lanyard so you can wear it around your neck which is added protection if your up on a ladder. The driver itself works well, as expected. We havent noticed any issues with the battery life being short. Overall, my husband likes it.

Rose is dhampir, the offspring of a human and vampire. Lissa is Moroi, a mortal vampire with magical powers the Strigoi are evil immortal vampires that kill to survive.  Rose is Lissas Guardian, sworn to protect her at any cost. Her wants and needs come second to Lissas. Rose and Lissa have been best friends since childhood, and shed never questioned the cost of giving up her personal life to protect Lissa, but now shes haunted by a growing sense of resentment. After the death of a friend, Rose is troubled by dark thoughts and impulses and her crush on the handsome teacher Dimitri spirals out of control.  I hadnt read any of the previous novels in the series before picking up Shadow Kiss, but even so, Mead makes the backstory accessible to new readers. Rose is a captivating narrator, strongwilled and impulsive. Her blossoming relationship with Dimitri is handled tactfully, and provides a sweet counterpoint to the violence that is unleashed upon St. Vladimirs. In many ways, St. Vladimirs presents all of the typical high school drama cliques, catty remarks, annoying teachers, drunken parties, but with the element of magic and vampiric royalty. Its much more threedimensional than some other recent vampire young adult fiction.

Also featured is his stunning cover of Carrickfergus, which is drenched in melancholy and yearning, his classic take on Van Morrisons Crazy Love, See Line Woman, and several other tracks.  First of all, this collection is a real bargain, since Brians earlier albums and current! are largely available as importonly in the US, which is a shame, because Brians soulful lyrics, gossamer voice, and strong arrangements should be appreciated by a wider audience his concert DVD ASINB0002IQC98 Live in Belfast is available through Curb Records.  Wont You Take Me Home introduces the listener to Brians evolving songwriting, his range of styles, and his understated acoustic guitar. Sprinkled throughout are love songs, melancholy ballads, and upbeat songs, along with some old favorites like Crazy Love I always thought that Brian thoroughly upstaged Van on ASINB000001E3L A Night in San Francisco!. If youre tired of listening to the same five alternative bands on the radio, give Brian Kennedy a chance. His unique voice, soulful lyrics and masterly guitar playing will refresh your spirit."},

I just cannot pay 7 more dollars for fluff, characters I will never see again being described in VIVID detail and a feeling of disappointment at the end of every book. This book and the two before it have just fallen flat. Based on the reviews, book ten is not a step in the right direction either. And while I would love to see how it ends, i just cant commit myself to five more books at this point. This series could have been ten action filled books, keeping me up for hours past my bed time and leaving me singing the praises of Robert Jordan.

  {"id": 2341, "content": "A trip down nostalgia lane... | 1998s Pleasantville is a charmingly executed parable about introducing change to a closed society, and the ripple effect that even the smallest changes can produce. Siblings David Tobey Maguire and Jennifer Reese Witherspoon are polar opposites nerdy David is obsessed with the ficticious 1950s sitcom Pleasantville an homage to Leave It To Beaver and other pictureperfect smallscreen families, while Jennifer hangs out with the fast crowd, smoking and snaring potential dates.  After a mysterious TV repairman Don Knotts gives the two a remote, theyre transported into the blackandwhite, pictureperfect town of Pleasantville, where the basketball team makes perfect baskets every shot and a nutritious dinner is always on the table thanks, mom!. Horrified, the two at first try to desperately find a way back. David has the advantage of being intimately familiar with the Pleasantville universe, and tries to steer Jennifer away from any seismic outbursts that would be out of place in placid Pleasantville, such as swearing, smoking, and heaven forbid, sex. Jennifer has her own agenda, though, and Lovers Lane soon becomes more than just a place to stargaze and hold hands. With each change comes the slow but sure colorization first bubblegum turns pink, then the more adventurous teens end up in color.  David and Jennifers parents, George William H. Macy and Betty Joan Allen Parker, are stamped straight out of 1950s legend George begins every evening by announcing honey, Im home! and Bettys always on call to whip up massive breakfasts or hors doeuvres. David, now Bud, works in the burger joint owned by Bill Jeff Daniels, whos paralyzed by indecision and any break in routine. But a funny thing happens the oncewild Jennifer slowly becomes more scholarly and more and more like her TV counterpart than her former bad girl self, while oncetimid David learns to stand up for himself and to fight for what he believes in.  In Pleasantville, the old guard is threatened by all of the changes the onceempty books in the library are filled, Bill realizes his lifes dream of becoming a painter, using every shade under the sun, rockabilly and rock and roll are heard...resulting in violence and trials that parallel McCarthyism. Betty and other wives begin to yearn for a fulfilling life outside of the home, leaving their husbands hungry and confused.  Although the visual metaphors are heavyhanded at times, Pleasantville does an admirable job at capturing the balance between modern uncertainties at school, the teens are given sobering statistics about AIDS, global warming, and underemployment and our rosetinted nostalgia for the past. The visual design deserves special mention, and the classic soundtrack is loaded with gems by Pat Boone, Miles Davis, Etta James, Elvis and Buddy Holly. Pleasantville was nominated for two dozen awards, and its easy to see why. A delightful film for the entire family."},

  {"id": 2381, "content": "One familys solution to the MadeInChina crisis | In recent years, Ive been growing more and more disheartened at the inevitability of escaping Made In China labels. Ive launched my own sort of Chinese boycott in recent years, and gladly pay more for American and Europeanmade goods if it means avoiding Chinas farreaching economic grasp. When I heard about A Year Without Made In China and saw Sara Bongiorni interviewed on CNN, I ran out to pick up a copy to see if her observations on buying Chinesefree meshed with my own.  Sara Bongiornis family spent one year in a boycott of Chinesemade goods, and A Year Without Made In China chronicles the authors eyeopening journey into the Chinese incursions on American manufacturing and investment. She already expects that certain items such as shoes, electronics, and small appliances come from China, but so do birthday candles, printer cartridges, humane mouse traps, plastic bags at the grocery store, lamp switches, hardware, craft supplies, and holiday decorations. The book includes a nifty index if you want to see the extent of Chinas influence looming over our daily lives.  It is especially salient in light of the recent numbers of toxic Chinese products that have been recalled childrens toys full of lead paint and dangerous magnets 80 of toys in the US are made in China, flammable and poisonous clothing a recent report in New Zealand found formaldehyde present at 900 times the safe level, toxic toothpaste and counterfeit medicines, and poisoned pet food responsible for the death of thousands of cats and dogs. Bongiornis book does not address the issue of Chinese recalls this would make an excellent followup investigative report, along with a topic she briefly touches on Chinese food in our grocery stores Sara was horrified at her weekly purchases of Mandarin oranges when she realized where they came from. Because most foods do not tell where individual ingredients come from, Chinesemade ingredients are virtually impossible to identify take the recent Veggie Booty recall using salmonellatainted seasoning powder from China.  Bongiorni makes it clear from the start that shes not out to get China in fact, she has a distant Chinese ancestor, Mr. Chang, who immigrated to Germany. Nor does her boycott have anything to do with Free Tibet politics, or as a commentary on how the Chinese government treats workers in its sweatshop factories. It is not pointing a finger at the environmental rape, industrial pollution, and global warming that China is contributing to. Instead, Sara and her family husband Kevin and two young children want to see if it is even possible to live without bringing China into their home as a simple economic experiment.  The boycott hits hardest for Saras two young children, toddlers Wes and Sophie. She finds it impossible to explain the boycott to fouryearold Wes, who is constantly asking for green plastic light swords, robots, and mote katrol remote control trucks. She also has a gargantuan task in finding nonChinese toys for Wes to take to birthday parties, and Christmas shopping is similarly fraught with Chinese toy peril. Sara spends hundreds of dollars on a German dollhouse family that seems woefully inadequate to modern kid sensibilities.  At the end of the experiment, Sara finds that her husband Kevin, the one shes dubbed The Weakest Link for smuggling Chinese contraband into their Chinafree house, is in favor of continuing the boycott. They eventually discard this as impractical, since it would leave them with no way to repair broken appliances, but it did make the Bongiorni family much more thoughtful as to where their merchandise came from.  Yes, its still possible to find nonChinese goods, but it requires diligent label reading, spending more money Saras husband Kevin is surprised to discover that Frances tourist trade is becoming as Chinese as the US, and many annoyed salespeople her conversations with catalog customer service are priceless. In light of the dozens of hazardous recalls of Chinese products, maybe everyone should read and try! A Year Without Made In China."},

She loves the pockets! They accommodate her iPhone nicely. I was a little worried that they might be too thin, but they seem to be thick enough.

  {"id": 2418, "content": "Great Fun Never Disappoints Not for Everyone | Its hard to give 5stars to an album by the guy who made Tip Toe Through the Tulips a big hit, but this album deserves it.  Many people dont take Tiny very seriously, although if you can believe it, the official website says he took himself seriously.  This is not really a serious album, but who says music has to be serious?  It is great fun and shows what a great talent Tiny really was.  Not everyone will like his singing, as he switches from his beautiful deep baritone voice into a falsetto one and back again in some of the songs.  These songs are great fun and Tiny has his own way of making old standards sound like completely new songs.  Tinys voice practically vibrates at times and while his fans like this aspect, it can irritate some listeners.  I think this album is a real classic and it is very unique not like anything else out there.  Youll either love it or hate it.  I loved it."},

I love this new model from Waterpik, I love the size, the set up, the quietness and the modern appearance it has sitting on my bathroom vanity. It flosses amazing and when I first used it I found a lot of bleeding with my gums, but now having used it for almost two weeks now daily, my gums are not bleeding.

The only thing I need to point out is that you should take it to a laundromat unless you have an enormous washer  dryer. I have a standard size of both  I was JUST able to cram it in. I ended up basically handwashing it bc I didnt want to break my washer. It took 3 hours  45 minutes to dry on medium heat. It came vacuum sealed  puffed up a lot after cleaning it. There was no lint or fuzz at all in the lint catcher after all that drying time so the fabric its made of is durable  of high quality.

The four best friends Tibby, Carmen, Lena, and Bee spend more time apart than together, and their link to each other is through the magical Pants.  In their final summer, Lena struggles with art school and a new crush after overcoming her heartbreak with Kostos, Tibby and Brian explore their relationship in greater detail, Bee goes on an archaeological dig in Turkey, and the oncebuoyant Carmen gains twenty pounds and becomes invisible at college until shes unexpectedly cast in a professional theater production.  An upcoming sequel to the first Warner Brothers film, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, is largely based on Forever In Blue.  One major observation is that from its lighthearted origins about the summer adventures of four best friends, the tone is decidedly adult and pessimistic here. Several characters engage in sexual activity, and although the sex is not described in graphic details, the girls do reflect on the feelings and sensations that result, so this isnt appropriate for younger readers.  The stories were generally depressing, focusing on heartbreak and regret, manipulation, and depression. The climax was completely out of sync with the rest of the book, although the final message was solid the girls didnt really need magic pants to bind them together, but their faith in each other. Several excellent quotes are sprinkled throughout the chapters, but overall, this isnt an appropriate novel for younger readers, and was a fairly pessimistic close to an original series."},

I have only 1 issue with this book and that is for me,there were too many characters for me to follow. Now mind you,that is not a bad thing about this book,it is something that I have always had an issue with...and with that being said,,I think Madison wrote another great book in the continuing story of Agnes and Eleanor,the funniest senior sleuths ever. Finally,after all their antics,they are sent to prison!! But its not what you might think. Strange enough,this time they have not committed any crimes. They are sent there by Peterson to investigate the murder of a prisonerhairdresser. The inmates in this womans prison are ready to riot,thinking that a guard has committed the murder. The guards think it had to have been an inmate. The girls begin to ask questions when another inmate is murdered,but this one is a guards helper,and Is as well loved by both inmates and guards just like the hairdresser,so who would have wanted to kill them and why?, and who is the quiet timid girl ,that comes to the prison on the jail bus with Agnes and Eleanor? No one knows about the mission,not the warden,not even Andrew and Mr. Wilson the husbands.. Agnes and Eleanor find out what being in prison is really like,and learn the stories of who the other girls are and what got them in there. I really liked this book because it made Agnes and Eleanor,appreciate what they have on the outside...and yes,its a fun read !!! Another hit Madison..."},

  {"id": 2515, "content": "Arabian Nights will infuse your kitchen with the captivating aromas of the Middle East | Over the past several years, Ive taught hundreds of students from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and UAE, and they were eager to share their native cuisine with me we would frequently have Saudi coffee breaks with homemade pastries courtesy of their wives, or talk about the finer points of making kabsa or hunting for desert truffles. I was interested in learning more about these dishes, but found that most recent cookbooks on Middle Eastern cooking were focused more on Turkey, Morocco, Syria, or Iran with the exception of one or two recent releases like ASIN1566568498 Cardamom and Lime Recipes from the Arabian Gulf.  I own Habeeb Salooums excellent ASIN1566563984 Classic Vegetarian Cooking from the Middle East and North Africa, so I was very interested to see his The Arabian Nights Cookbook. Arabian Nights revisits and  expands upon several Gulf favorites first introduced in his Classic Vegetarian Cooking and includes the many chicken, lamb and seafood dishes found in the Gulf, including kabsa, almandi, zurbian, laham mini Saudi pizzas that are distinct from their Syrian cousins, and several Indianinspired fish preparations including a Kuwaiti fish curry.  In Arabian Nights, youll find numerous suggestions from appetizers to Gulfstyle coffee and beverages  to round out  your meal although strangely there is no mention of Saudi coffee made with freshly roasted green coffee beans and sweets including baklava, a heavenly cardamomscented fruit salad, fritters and other fried desserts, and rosewaterscented custards and puddings. Most recipes here use at least  stick of butter or  cup of oil for the rice dishes, and there are many fried dishes, but there are also a wide variety of fresh, delicious vegetable salads, pickled veggies, and yogurtbased dips and drinks represented, so you can assemble your own Arabianinspired meal however you wish including vegetarian, as there are many wonderful salads, soups, breads and rice dishes to choose from.  The book begins with a compact illustrated glossary of useful tools and implements particularly related to brewing and serving Gulfstyle coffee and an illustrated list of essential Arabian ingredients that gives names in English and Arabic. Several basic recipes including pickled garlic, strained yogurt and tangy hot tomato sauce set the stage. Youll find many familiar dishes that have migrated to the Gulf such as baba ghanouj, muhammara, hummus and tabbouleh, a lovely orange and olive salad originally from Morocco, and many imports by way of India baqoura pakoras, samboosak samosas, curries, etc. Each recipe gives a brief history of the dish and its origins, along with preparation tips and hints.  I tried several of the recipes including Mung Beans and Rice with Almonds, Aromatic Rice with Almonds, Sweet Holiday Biscuits, Sweetened Vermicelli Omelet, Olive and Orange Salad, Zesty Tomato and Fresh Coriander Salad, and the Refreshing Green Salad. The first time I made the Mung Beans and Rice with Almonds, I followed the recipe exactly, and I found the cooking time FAR too long 25 minutes at a simmer followed by 30 minutes to steam off the heat the rice had disintegrated into a glutinous paste rather than fluffy separate grains. I tossed out the first batch and started over, but this time I used the directions from the Aromatic Rice with Almonds, fusing the two recipes I added raisins with the mung beans and used the larger quantity of almonds, which only has you cook the rice for 12 minutes before steaming for 30. This time, the rice was fluffy and perfectly cooked, so I would start with half the cooking time if youre following the recipe for Mung Beans.  I also enjoyed learning to make Arabian breads like sweet holiday biscuits khubz mohala, a yeasted dough sweetened with date syrup I made my own using the instructions in the sidebar that makes a lovely accompaniment to coffee and dates. The dessert section contains standards like baklava as well as a cardamomscented fruit salad with a fabulous cardamom honey dressing thats great on any kind of fruit.  The instructions are straightforward and most of the ingredients should be easy to find, although you may have to mail order some of the spices such as zatar, sumac, date syrup and rose  orange blossom water depending on whether you have any Middle Eastern  Indian markets in your area. The book is gorgeous to look at as well there are photos for nearly every recipe, as well as some stepbystep photos for the more difficult ones stuffing lamb  veal. There is also a suggested resource guide arranged by geographic regions of the U.S. and Canada. The index includes English recipe titles only.  Mr. Salloum has created a wonderful, compact introduction to Gulf cooking that is accessible by all levels of home chefs most importantly, his recipes are practical for home kitchens my students used to regale me with tales of roasting a whole camel in a pit in the Saudi desert luckily the largest thing in this cookbook is the roast leg of lamb!. The Arabian Nights Cookbook will infuse your kitchen with the captivating tastes and aromas of the Arabian Gulf and add a whole new layer of flavor to your repertoire!

In addition, there are time when I would like to have my ipad plugged into the rear top dock and watch something on netflix.  I cant do it because the netflix app runs in landscape mode and the ipad must be up  down to be plugged in.  The guard on the front dock needs to be removable and the plugs should turn in some way so you can run your phone or tablet in the landscape view.  So, if you want the dock to play music its great.

  {"id": 2567, "content": "Entertaining adaption of a modern Disney classic | For some odd reason I had a compelling need to play this game after I saw several reviews and trailers online. So I tracked it down and paid more than ... by far, but I certainly got my enjoyment from it. The graphics looked great on my computer, and the video quality of the clips between levels looked as good as a DVD version. The skill level could be changed from easy to hard, and additional challenges were sometimes added the harder the level of difficulty. The music was almost an exact duplicate of the Tarzan soundtrack, featuring instrumental versions of the songs Trashing the Camp, Son of Man and others. The graphics were amazing, especially the backgrounds and waterfall effects. Some dexterity is needed, but younger children should be able to play this game with some help setting up. I used a computer game pad with joystick and it was very easy to control TarzanTerkJane. There are bonus levels and cutscenes to collect, and the game has definite replay value, especially if your kids love Tarzan. I still havent managed to beat it on the Hard level yet, so there are hours of gaming pleasure ahead. And at less than ... it makes a perfect gift."},

The letter paint is literally see through on some of them with the bead color showing  others have extra black paint on them like the painter touched them with paint on their fingers.  Amazon is sending a replacement so I will update the review after I receive them.  I wish the seller would have distributed the letters better. Giving nearly 30 z and x, but only 4 or 5 of other letters is just ridiculous. It feels like they were just trying to get rid of letters they had an abundance of from other kits. So far Im not impressed. I suggest you go over the letters on the beads with paint or pigma pens  seal them w a clear coat as other reviews say the paint washes off.  My plan was to use them in resin.

  {"id": 2597, "content": "Better than most ice scrapers but still falls short of perfection | I purchased the twopack of these because I was tired of the different plastic ice scrapers I had that didnt do a good job on hard ice.  From September to April I have to scrap my car windows almost daily.  This scraper is one of the better tools because there are three different scraping positions.  You can scrape in the position shown although I had trouble keeping it in that position, you can fold the two larger blades back to expose only the smaller blade, or you can fold all the blades in front for a stronger scraping action although sometimes the ice gets caught between the different blades forcing them to separate a bit which means you need to clear the ice to continue.  This is the best scraper I used so far because it scrapes away thicker ice easily when in the reinforced position with all blades out front.  It also works well, but not great, to dislodge the thick concrete ice I get on my windshield.  I feel this product could be improved by making the blades stronger and have a locking mechanism that keeps the blades in the standlike position like shown in picture and in the reinforced position with all blades out front.  Because the blades are slightly pliable and not as firm as a thick steel knife, scraping away ice is still not as easy as wiping away snow from a windshield but it is a whole lot better with this tool. One other issue I found is that the blade only scrapes half of its length so if you use the small blade only whats in the center gets scraped away, meaning youll have more passes.  However, this is still a worthwhile purchase for me because its a lot easier to scrape away the ice with this tool than any other scraper I tried before."},

  {"id": 2610, "content": "Touching memoir of an appalling childhood | When I first received this book to review, I saw that the author had written a previous account of her early childhood in foster care, Somebodys Someone.  I ordered this book from the library, thinking it would give me insight into the current book, and it does.  If you have time, I urge you to read Somebodys Someone first, as it will give you background and context.  Frankly, it is better written as well.  However, I do not want to take anything away from Someone Has Led This Child to Believe.  Regina continues the account of her life through adolescence and early adulthood, and it is difficult for this middle class white woman to comprehend how she survived with her spirit and mind intact.  I am sure writing these books has been cathartic for her, and I applaud all those who tried to help, and especially those who succeeded.  Most readers will be appalled at the abuse, physical, mental, sexual, psychological, that Regina lived through.  Essentially abandoned by her mother and father, sent from foster home to group home to the homes of parents she did not know. Expected to clean the house and care for younger children when only a child herselfhow she survived this is nothing short of a miracle.  And the miracle comes in the form of people who saw something of value in Regina and led her to believe in herself and her future.  This book will appeal to those who are interested in children, such as foster parents and teachers, but it is not an easy read.  It is a good and necessary book, however.  Highly recommended."},

  {"id": 2614, "content": "Vent Clip Barely Fits Into 2003 Honda Civics Widest Vent Openings Wireless Charging Is Convenient | UPDATE 71418  Star rating downgraded from 4 stars to 1 star.  The wIreless charging pad is too flaky to rely upon.  After a week of use, my phone became reluctant to recognize the pador vice versaand I had to reposition the phone, wiggle the cable, or plug and unplug the cable to get wireless charging to work at all.  The problem is with the charging pad, because the cable and 34cigarette lighter34 plug will charge my phone fast if the cable is plugged directly into the phone.  ORIGINAL REVIEW  The vent clip clamps on this VENTEX WIRELESSPRO DOCK are almost too thick to fit into the widest vent openings on the far left and right in my 2003 Honda Civic.  The vent clip itself is very stiff to open, and barely opens wide enough to fit around the vent slats.  Once installed, the vent clip holds tightly and securely.  The phone holder easily accepts my Samsung Galaxy S7 inside an Otterbox Symmetry case.  Its nice to have a wireless charger on the dashboard, so that I dont have to keep two phone cables in the car one for a phone with a Micro AB port, and one for a phone with a Type C port.  The wireless charger seems to work fine.  My Galaxy phone indicated right away that it was charging.  With a lock screen active display on, the charger added about 13 to the charge level during a 15minute auto trip.  With the powerdraining Google Maps navigation display with sound turned on, the charger just barely maintained the existing charge level.  My phone was also quite hot afterwardsnot uncommon with qi charging when a network connection is active, or with Google Maps live navigation generallyso in the future Ill probably use the charging only when Im NOT using Google Maps live navigation or am using it only briefly.  The plug fits rather tightly into the DC power cigarette lighter receptacle on my Honda, but thats okay. The cable is long enough to easily reach from the left side air vent to the receptacle, which is below the radio in the middle of the dashboard."},

Well I should clarify, it does not fit me like it should, but I can make it work for what I need it for.  If you are above average height or have a long torso, I would be wary of this, its runs kind of short. I have to yank it up to get it to come high enough for me to cover my bust, and even then it still isnt quite high enough to look great at the top. I bought it for a wedding dress though that has a pretty structured top with cups built in, so it wasnt going to be an issue for me. But for others, it definitely would. I agree with others that say the cups run small also. I spill out the sides of it.  Now for the positive, this really sucks you in. Without it, I have a small amount of extra fabric along the waistline of the dress. With it, it almost works too well for me, I would say I have about 34 inches of loose fabric now. Like it borders on making me wish I had the extra time to see if I could get the dress taken in a bit, it works that well.  With the way that this bodysuit is designed, it really helps to pull me in right at my natural waistline and does a nice job of smoothing in other places. I just wish I could get it in a size up to possibly rectify the length issue."},

As soon as I opened it and set it up, you could see the lid would not seal on the crock.  It rocked. Not just a little.  A LOT.  So I contacted customer service at Calphalon. They asked for proof I purchased and they would send me a new crock and lid.  So far, its been 3 weeks.  They said it could take 68 weeks and apparently so.  I am very disappointed.  Cant speak to how the crock works, waiting for the new crock and lid.  I am sad my old faithful, 10 year old, 20 crock pot died.  At least it worked right out of the box and for more than 10 years.  It wasnt fancy, with timers and such.  It just worked.  Sigh. I will update when I FINALLY receive the properly fitting crock and lid.  UPDATE My apologies for not updating earlier. I had to contact the the company for a THIRD time. I was told the replacement requests had been misplaced. Then I was told they were backordered. I have no idea which was true. After this third person to person contact with the company I received the replacements about 3 weeks later. I have not yet tried the replacements as I have been traveling.

Frank gives you a rare unvarnished look into how a group of diverse individuals comes together and is molded into Americas most elite fighting force. He describes how his team meticulously prepared for war, but got caught up in petty SF group politics and turf battles before they fired their first shot. He gives it to you straight  the good, the bad, and the ugly.

  {"id": 2650, "content": "Sturdy, long ,  but shorter from back to front! | I have been using these types of trunk organizer in my SUVs for almost 20 yrs. I use them about twice a week for grocery shopping mainly and my bags have never fallen over or out of these.  This is my review how I use these, and I do have kids, and sport stuff for them , also these certainly do come in handy for Costco shopping and even clothes shopping etc.  Im a shopper.  This one is sturdy, but a bit different then the other two I have had, and I was now due for a new organizer.  In this There is inside cover boards for the bottom to make it more stable, that come down to cover the inside of each slot , never had that before, and never needed it!  Also there is a problem, cause to fold this up and get it out of the way, now I have to pull those bottom things up also to just push this together, and out of the way. When your finish using this for the day, this all comes together, and you can snap it all closed.  Hummmm! You might say, just leave them alone, but Im thinking , there is a reason in this organizer to use them, or my stuff is going to fall over , or this is going to fall apart ! Also comes with some types of straps to tie it down ? Why if its suppose to be so sturdy? Unless your putting this on the luggage rack on the top of your car ha ha haaaa...  This is my main problem with this This is longer then what I have been using  but does not measure as wide from Back to Front! And only gives 3 slots for my grocery bags, and my other two had 4 large slots, and since those were wider in the front I could also put a bag of potatoes , onions,  bananas etc. in the front of the organizer along with the grocery bag.  Also I live in the mountains and when I go shopping down the mountain I bring those types of cold bags with blue ice in them. Those bags usually stay on the right side next to the organizer, but since this is longer, and those are heavy, there is not much room for them, and I have to lift them Over this organizer and stuff.  This organizer has two dividers which gives you a little more space for another bag you might think, but that space is tiny, cannot hold another grocery bag, and makes the slots even smaller.  On the outside there is small netting pockets, but  for me there useless. I guess they might hold a small childs book, or some folded up baby wipes!  Before buying these organizers, measure your sports equipment first, and the grocery bags you usually use.  I usually use Trader Joes , there regular ones I buy, or the regular paper bags. Where I live they do not use plastic bags even in target. Good idea.  After all this, you might wonder why did I buy this one! Because it now seems these have only 3 slots, and these have become even more pricey.! Its called, A Upgrade and we all fall for it lol.  4 stars."},

I waffled between a 3 and a 4 star rating but, because it stuttered a fair amount along the way, its a 3.  Inspector McDonald is called in to investigate the possible murder of famous writer Ruth Surray, one of the famous offspring of a well known Professor.  Her death was ruled a suicide.  Ruth was at her family home with invited guests, several men including some connected to her writing world.  Her younger sister Naomi has just finished school and is competition in some ways for Ruth, particularly in love.  She is home too.  Richard, their famous brother who is a psychologist is aware Ruth seemed dispirited and the whole family hoped to quickly move through a postmortem and expose their famous sisterdaughter as little as possible to sensationalism.  Then Richard receives a letter and Inspector McDonald and his very appealing sidekick, Detective Reeves get involved.  The characters are not deep, but enjoyably written.  The plot and investigation are fine and all clues are there for the ultimate result.  There is humor.  There is time spent hither and yon.  Others are threatened in menacing ways.  Definitely a good read for Agatha Christie fans.  The writing, while good of its type, is a bit simple for my taste."},
  {"id": 2700, "content": "Not What I Expected | After mostly glowing reviews I really expected something very different and better.  There are times when it seems that Eva has the voice of an angel other times she seems to sound more like a screeching banshee.  Well maybe not that bad, but I agree with many reviewers that she cant hit the high notes very well.  This is very evident in Time is a Healer and Oh, Had I a Golden Thread which are terrible at certain points.  Fields of Gold is excellent Wade in the Water is good too.  For the most part her voice is crystal clear with no hesitation or wavering very smooth and soothing, until she tries to hit those high notes.  Over the Rainbow is not bad, but is sung a bit too slow, so it doesnt sound quite right.  There have been several better renditions than the original Garland version believe it or not Tom T. Hall does it better than Eva. I am not kidding.  Autumn Leaves is beautifully done, but again a little slower than I like to hear it. The remaining songs on the album are not bad, but nothing overly memorable.  I think Eva could have been so much better perhaps there are better albums she has done.  This is my first one.  Another thing that I didnt like too much is that she can be singing very, very softly one minute and then suddenly get really loud.  A better selection of songs might have helped, as would some coaching on her technique.  Sometimes her lovely voice would almost make me shiver with the absolute beauty of it other times I would almost cringe.  Sad she was taken from us so young before she had time to develop.  Had she learned how to either avoid or hit the high notes and changed her technique a little, she would have been impossible to beat.  Ill keep the album it has some moments that are just beautiful and wonderful.  Before you buy, you might want to listen to the whole album.  You may really love it...or not."},

Once again, a food product that has unnecessary chemicals added to it. Gotta love the so called FDA, that is not always looking out for our best interest. I truly do blame our FDA more than the company. Whos watching the watchers? Many added chemicals to the American food supply are not only banned, but illegal in many other countries for known harms to humans, as well as the environment our government tells us their care so much about. Illegal  Let that sink in for a moment. Illegal for known harms such as, but not limited to infertility, cancer, ADHD, learning disabilities, ADD, neurological disorders and neurotoxic, diabetes, endocrine disrupters, inflammation to name a few. One should ask themselves, and perhaps their government, politicians and health agencies this. If other countries can create the same or similar products without using these chemicals, then why do we Americans not get the same? Celery seed  rosemary can be used as a food preservative. Natural coloring can come from carrots, turmeric, beets etc. Do why use artificial chemical coloring dyes? Until we shut off Netflix for a bit, learn, share, and get completely frustrated and angry, then demand change by not buying these products as a first step, why would they ever stop. Oh and BTW, these chemicals substitutes arent always even cheaper. Some are actually MORE expensive to use. Again, let that sink in!"},

The hoses lengthen when filled with water and shrink when they are emptied  I store mine in a small terra cotta pots. They dont need to be 34wound34 up. Its so easy to just pull them out and turn on the water.  Its just easier hose use in my opinion. Ive purchased several different brands and this is the first time I have purchased this brand.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  At this point, I feel confident in recommending this particular brand."},

They came from one of the corners. Its not super noticeable, so I decided to go ahead and hang it on the wall. Its not invisible though and since I know where it is, I do see it. I tried to take a picture of it, but being that its a mirror, it kept getting everything else in the picture reflections and those made it difficult to see the chipped area."},

We have a water dispenser on our refrigerator, but the temperature of the water is not as cold as I would like it to be. So I have been keeping this full of water inside my refrigerator. Its tall and skinny, so it doesnt take up much space in my refrigerator. The glass is solid. Water pours easily without dripping or leaking from the stainless lid. You dont have to unscrew or push anything for water to dispense, you just pour. At dinner time, I keep this on the table so my family can refill their glasses without getting up from the table. This works so much better than a regular pitcher and it looks great, too!  I received this for free in exchange for my honest amp unbiased review. My thoughts amp opinions are my own."},

  {"id": 2726, "content": "Delicious, approachable Greek comfort food | Cooking with Loula is the beautiful cookbookslashmemoir of Alexandra Stratou, Athens native and classically trained chef, that centers on the recipes of Kyria Mrs. Loula, her grandmothers cook. Kyria Loula had worked for several generations of the Stratou family, creating dishes that nourished the physical body as well as sustained family traditions and memories.  I first discovered this title on NetGalley where Ive been a reviewer for the past couple of years as a huge fan of all things Greek, I was eager to dive into the galley and later the physical copy. As I work fulltime and have very little time for cooking during the week, I was hoping that the recipes would be on the simple side luckily this is so, with short ingredient lists yet delicious results.  I love that not only does Ms. Stratou include pantry staples, but also includes other essential tips, my personal favorite being Bless your food when you reach the point where it could turn into a success or a failure. A lovely illustrated guide to essential tools and a guide to cooking with the seasons rounds out the introduction. The seasonal chart will help you choose recipes based on what is in season at the moment and of course, if you can support your local farmers market if you have one, your recipe will turn out all the better for it.  And here is the major difference between Greek cooking and our modern lives In Greece particularly Crete, meals still revolve around seasonality. A tomato should only be consumed when in season, unlike the plastic tasteless varieties available yearround at American grocery stores. I subscribe to a biweekly organic CSA box from Nagano, and each week get to cook with sometimes new and novel ingredients this weeks box included huge okra, eggplant, tomatoes, cucumbers, and red shiso, many of which also feature prominently in Greek cuisine.  Recipes are arranged with the home cook in mind weekday recipes are specifically geared towards the harried modern cook, featuring dishes that can be on the table in half an hour or less. These include spanakopita, gemista, pastitsio, tomatostewed chicken with orzo, stuffed zucchini, and ovenbaked sea bass. Sundays includes more ambitious recipes with longer cook times, designed to let you linger over the table with family. Standouts include Hunkiar Beyendi beef stew with smoked eggplant puree, chicken pie, stuffed cabbage leaves, beef stifado, roast pork with apple and onion, and galaktoboureko.  Summer Holidays includes lighter fare like kaiki tuna salad, blackeyed pea salad, mini cheese pies, octopus marinated in vinegar, and dips. Fried fish, ovenbaked eggplant, grilled fish, potato salad, baklava and chocolate mousse round out the chapter. Traditions captures major Greek holidays, beginning with New Years vasilopita, deepfried salt cod served on March 25, koulourakia Easter butter cookies, Tsoureki Easter bread, ovenroasted lamb served on Holy Saturday, and Christmas cookies and cakes will all brighten your holiday table. Essential Recipes includes stocks, sauces beacutechamel, avgolemono, mayonnaise, kimas, and pastry cases crusts. The book closes with beautiful dedications to Kyria Loula and Giagia Sofia.  Ive made several of the recipes from Cooking With Loula, beginning with the gemista stuffed vegetables. My mother used to prepare stuffed peppers, but I was never a fan of green peppers in particular, so for this recipe I substituted the sweeter orange, red, and yellow bell peppers. In Japan it is difficult to find large tomatoes heirlooms are apparently unknown here, so I used all peppers for stuffing, fitting them snugly into my Emile Henry pie dish. The end result was a delicious blend of rice I used Arborio, raisins and pine nuts that thankfully also freezes supremely well I had the leftovers for lunches the following week. Fellow vegetarians and pescetarians will be in heaven, as Greek cuisine is tremendously vegetarianfriendly aided by the large number of fasting days in the Greek Orthodox calendar.  In Alexandras words, This cookbook is as much about my family as any other. We all have our own stories, our own tastes, our own memories, but no matter what they are, when talking about them we speak the same language. The places of the past we travel to are highly personal, but the journey is universal. I hope you hold this book in your hands and take some time  not only to cook, but to think about your past and what it means to you. Cooking with Loula will send you forward on a delicious journey, not only to discover Loulas recipes, but to reconnect and create your own lasting food memories glass of Greek wine and Greek soundtrack in the background highly recommended but optional. Happy cooking!  This review originally published on BundtLust on 21 August 2016"},

The bottom line usually is what the dog likes other than price considerations, of course.  Unfortunately my big hound dog didnt seem to like this very much.  My little chihuahua liked it and started eating the first time I put it down, but she doesnt eat much dry food, as she has so few teeth left, so sticks mainly with wet food.  My suggestion is the same as when I review any dog food buy the smallest bag you can to try it first to see if the dog will eat it well.  I would try this one and some other premium foods to see what your dog or dogs like best.  They may really like this one.  I can only rate 3 stars because my dog just didnt go much for it."},
  {"id": 2738, "content": "One of the Best Old Time Singers You Never Heard Of | If you like the singers and the music of the 30s youll love this set.  Al Bowlly is not as well known the the U.S. as he is in the U.K. where he made over 1,000 recordings between 1927 and 1941.  Perhaps you could call him the Bing Crosby of the U.K. however he doesnt sound at all like Bing.  Bowlly has a gentle, soothing voice, but its not quite a smooth as some singers. In spite of that, everything he sings on these 3 CDs sounds effortless.  The only problem I have with this set is that on many of the songs, the vocal portion of the song is 14 to 13 of each song and the rest is instrumental.  Its really great band music, so its still very pleasant to listen to, but I would have preferred much longer vocals.  It is probably partly due to the style of the time in which vocals didnt always run for the entire song.  Often the vocal doesnt even start until an instrumental leadin and sometimes the vocal doesnt go to the end of a selection either.  There are some real gems in this collection of which Nicky the Greek is one.  His South of the Border is as good as any I have ever heard. Some songs such as Over the Rainbow are done somewhat different than you might be used to, but its like hearing a new song instead of the same old tired treatments that you may have heard over and over again.  Bowlly doesnt quite have the same pazazz as some singers the songs seem a little subdued at times and might be slightly boring to some listeners who like more passionate singers who put a lot of effort into their songs or who like livlier arrangements.  Bowlly sometimes sounds like he is coasting and not working very passionately.  Perhaps he was just so good that he just made it sound easy.  Every song is smooth and effortless, which is probably a tribute to Bowllys ability to handle just about any material easily.  This set should be part of any complete collection of 30s music."},

In using this Slide product by Arm and Hammer, I did like the way the litter did easily slide out I did it after the first pour so I could do this review accurately. However, the next few times when I was just scooping the littler, I didnt like the way this cat litter clumps. In fact, it clumps poorly and I found that it was difficult to clean the cat litter on a maintenance basis litter crumbles and does not clump adequately. As far as odor control goes, again for the litter that cleaned it was great. But for the litter that crumbled I found an odor still remained and was only good when the entire litter was removed. I am rating this as 4 stars because it does what it says for total cat letter box clean up.

  {"id": 2770, "content": "I was disappointed with this book | Frankly, I was disappointed with this book. I actually had to force myself to finish it, which is a very unusual situation for me. I have read every single other book about Kit several times, and enjoyed them all, mainly due to the fact that they were set in the Great Depression.  Well written historical fiction is my favorite type of book to read. This book makes only one reference to the Depression, literally only one sentence. If I was not familiar with Kits character already, I would not have known what the setting was, due to the lack of historical references. There is very little continuity between the events and characters in the former books and this one. Lastly, the concluding 34Peek Into the Past34 section, always present in the other Kit mystery books, has been reduced to two pages and no historical photographs. If this is what the content and format of the 34Beforever34 books is going to be like, I doubt seriously if I will buy any more."},

  {"id": 2780, "content": "Remarkable Novel on Race, Love and Points of View | t is 1957. Alice grew up in rural Alabama, working the land with her family. Her mother died when she was young. Her sister Rosie took off for Chicago. Alice hasnt heard from Rosie for years. And now, with her fathers death, she has to leave. The landlord got the worst of his effort to assault Alice.  After she buries him, she boards a bus, heading for Chicago. But when the bus stops in a town where all the residents are Negro and there are no colored entrances to the train station, Alice is drawn to stay and make her life in New Jessup, Alabama. She is a gifted seamstress and she finds work in a store operated by a woman who becomes a mentor. She meets a local mechanic, Raymond Campbell, who lives on some acreage with his father. And she is faced, just at the start of the southern civil rightsvoting rights movement with an array of ways to think about race, equal rights, and sovereignty.  For New Jessup has a terrible past and tremendous community pride that is balanced on a treacherously unstable concept. When reconstruction hit, the former enslaved residents moved to the other side of the railroad tracks in Jessup, a situation that made the white townspeople uneasy. Their part of town was called, Negro Jessup, until 1903.  That is when the riots happened.  White residents tore through Negro Jessup, stole everything in sight and threw the residents out. The survivors of Negro Jessup who stayed moved to undesirable swampland, in an area on the other side of the woods and founded New Jessup.  Ultimately, a lot of issues arise in this masterful book, about how the Black citizens of New Jessup have kept the peace with the white community of Jessup about younger folks who want to see some change to ensure New Jessup has sufficient independence to withstand another 1903 charge and about how the burgeoning civil rights movements philosophy of integration is at odds with New Jessups philosophy of intentional separation. The town itself is the primary character in the novel, with the elders committed to the way things have been for over fifty years, the outside agitators being other Black people from the national civil rights movement, and the young men and women in the town looking to make adjustments and bring about a new, New Jessup. The characters are uniformly well drawn as the townspeople find friction where there once was acceptance of all things necessary to maintain the status quo. The elders see the shaky relationship with the powers that be in Jessup as the price to pay to be left in peace.  The next generation says that price is too heavy a price to pay."},

  {"id": 2783, "content": "Dear, if you make it with love, it will be delicious. Welcome to Alices Kitchen! | An accomplished writer and artist, Linda Dalal Sawayas family immigrated from Douma, Lebanon to Detroit in 1926 her grandmother Dalal and mother Alice Ganamey Sawaya, mother of five, grandmother of seven, greatgrandmother of nine, soon became famous for their cooking, and as the youngest of five daughters, Linda later became their kitchen assistant. In Alices Kitchen now in its fourth edition, Linda lovingly collects family portraits, memories, and over 100 traditional Lebanese dishes including mezza, salads, kebabs, stuffed veggies, and delicate desserts that capture the essence of Lebanons healthful, veggiecentric cuisine in a simple, easily approachable format. In addition, a portion of the proceeds benefits the children of Lebanon.  Linda, her artwork, and Alices Kitchen were featured prominently in an issue of the excellent magazine Aramco World, and Linda was kind enough to send a copy of the issue Memories of a Lebanese Garden, which features stunning cover paintings of the author and her mother in a garden filled with classic Lebanese imagery and produce as well as fullpage paintings of scenes from Douma, the author learning to toss bread in the air like her mother and grandmother before her, family portraits, and illustrated ingredients for the featured recipes ihjee, sambusak, mujaddrah, kusah mahshi, salatat bandurah Elis.  Lindas grandmother Dalal had lived through WWI, rationing, single parenting and a historic earthquake before joining her husband in Detroit having survived these hardships, she taught her children and grandchildren the art of recycling, conversation and not wasting even a single grain of rice. Moving to the US meant that new culinary skills had to be learned  where the town butcher in Douma had previously prepared various cuts of lamb, this was a luxury not available in 1950s Los Angeles, so Alice and Dalal learned to cut legs of lamb for various dishes, and how to bake their own bread huge, paperthin loaves. Linda grew up surrounded by an abundance of food, prepared not only for the family but also any visitors that happened to drop by, a hallmark of Lebanese hospitality. Her family kept a small kitchen garden where they grew mint, purslane, squash, grape leaves, and figs.  Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Alice, I feel as though I know her through reading Lindas stories and through the black and white photographs my own grandmother was named Alice and also immigrated to Michigan in my case, from Poland in 1913. She similarly preserved and passed down her heritage through her love of cooking and feeding family, so Alices Kitchen resonated deeply with me on many levels far beyond a simple culinary connection. As a child, I remember my grandmother recounting arriving at Ellis Island when I finally made it to Ellis Island in 1914 during a job interview in NYC, it was a highly charged emotional moment to see it from the ferry for the first time, just as my grandmother must have seen it. Now as an adult, I am attempting to reconnect with my immigrant heritage by trying to recapture the taste of my grandmothers home cooking. Unlike Linda, I was not fortunate enough to preserve my grandmothers recipes or to learn from her in the kitchen while she was still alive.  Having grown up surrounded by her familys Lebanese cuisine in Los Angeles, Linda had the chance to finally experience Lebanons culture and legendary hospitality for herself during a threemonth sojourn in 1971. Suddenly familiar rituals and flavors that shed taken for granted took on new meaning the artistry that her mother Alice incorporated was evident in every dish. This first encounter with Lebanon transformed her life and provided the starting point for Alices Kitchen.  Opening with a very helpful guide to About the Recipes, youll find a section on curing olives and pickling green, black, pickled turnips and vegetables, homemade cheese, yogurt and butter including Arabic cheese, labne, and clarified butter, sauces yogurt garlic, tahini, zaatar with olive oil. Salads are probably my favorite part of Lebanese cuisine, and youll find familiar favorites like fattoush and tabbouli alongside Salatat Elias tomato salad with garlic and spearmint, yogurt and cucumber, and Lebanese potato salad.  As lamb is a central component to many Lebanese dishes, there is an excellent illustrated guide to breaking down various cuts leg, breast, shoulder and many excellent serving suggestions shish kebab, grilled ground lamb, meat pies, and the national dish, kibbe nayye raw minced lamb and bulgur. Chicken and fish dishes will give you additional ideas for mains.  Being vegetarian, of course my favorite section was vegetarian entrees and vegetables, beans, and grains. Lebanese cuisine lends itself particularly well to vegetarian dishes such as mjaddrah lentils and rice with caramelized onions, fatayir spinach pies, ijjeh omelette with parsley, mint and onion, summer squash stuffed with rice, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, falafel and vegetarian kibbe. As a fan of both pumpkin and bulgur, the kibbet jlunt baked pumpkin and bulgur with pine nuts was a revelation. Her version of Mhammara grilled red pepper and walnut dip is superb just the right degree of tart from lemon juice and pomegranate molasses with a little kick from the chili paste I used Tunisian harissa, this addictive dip goes perfectly with veggies, pita, feta, and basically anything you can think of! And youll find the full range of wonderful Middle Eastern desserts, from walnut maamoul, atayif crepes with cheese or walnut filling, knafe, a delicately spiced rice pudding, and baklava rounded out with suggested drinks. Theres even a section on homemade preserves and fruit leathers fig jam with aniseed and walnuts, quince, apricot, and pumpkin and carrot infused with rose geranium petals.  Recipe names are given in transliterated Arabic as well as English Arabic titles are listed in italics in the index. Each recipe is introduced with a brief background into the dish, its importance in traditional Lebanese cuisine or preparation and serving tips, and family stories and traditions. A handy glossary breaks down Arabic terms for cooking, tools, ingredients, terms of endearments and hospitality, and sample menus for breakfast, lunch, mezza, dinner, and more.  Here is Lindas fabulous recipe for Mhammara  3 red bell peppers, roasted or grilled until blackened I used one jar drained roasted red peppers 1 cup walnuts 1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses 1 tablespoon chili paste I used harissa 3 cloves of garlic 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 teaspoon salt  teaspoon cayenne pepper optional  I skipped it 2 tablespoons sesame seeds I used toasted 2 tablespoons bread crumbs or more as needed  1. Place whole red peppers over a grill, or broil until blackened. This takes only a few minutes. Put hot peppers into a paper bag and close to cool. This makes them easy to peel. Under running water, remove all the blackened skin. Cut in half and remove seeds. Juices from the peppers can be used in the dip. 2. Put peppers and all of the remaining ingredients into a food processor and pulse just until the consistency is minced but not pureed. 3. Taste and add seasonings or bread crumbs as needed. Serve with Arabic bread, pita chips, or crackers. Makes 2 cups of dip, serving 8 to 10 for appetizers.  Overall, Alices Kitchen is a book I will be turning to again and again to make the most of summers bounty through simple, delicious recipes that preserve the unique flavors of the fruits and veggies that star in them.  As Linda so eloquently puts it, the appeal of traditional Lebanese cuisine is that Our tradition is about living gently on the earth. Using resources of the earth respectfully. Sharing and preparing food with love. Eating what is in season. Growing our own food as much as possible. Living simply and richly. Honoring the earth. Honoring ourselves and each other. This is my gesture to honor and preserve that culture for myself, for my family, and for others who appreciate these traditions, values, and foods. As Lindas mother Alice described it, Dear, if you make it with love, it will be delicious. Sallem dayetkoom!  A heartfelt shukran thank you to Linda for the review copy of Alices Kitchen, postcard featuring her original oil paintings, and copy of the January  February 1997 Aramco World magazine she was the cover story on."},
  {"id": 2784, "content": "Best Garlic Press! | This high quality garlic press is a nice  heavy weight steel tool. It does an excellent job of crushing garlic  I cant wait to try it with ginger. I usually use the minced garlic that comes in the jar because my previous garlic press was made entirely of plastic  was a pain to use. Every time I used my old plastic one, I was afraid it was going to break. I have no fears of this press breaking. It feels nice  solid in my hand and crushes the garlic almost effortlessly. Its completely changed my opinion about fresh garlic. Clean up is pretty easy. Although it says its dishwasher safe, I have been washing it by hand. I am very happy with it."},

It also blocked out my voice when I called to him when usually he can hear me after a moment or so. These are light weight and comfortable to wear. It was simple to pair with his phone.

They did put real rubber tires on this, so that makes it look more realistic.  Suitable mainly as a decorative item.  Would make a nice centerpiece for a table and you could use the truck bed for napkins if folded a certain way or for a few condiments, such as a salt and pepper shaker.  The truck has enough detail to be attractive and interesting, such as side mirrors and a steering wheel.  I knocked off one star on my rating just because the wheels are fixed in place.  I am happy with the item and will probably keep it, but it is suitable quality as a gift or regift for the right person."},

  {"id": 2800, "content": "Worked well for me, but follow instructions carefully | I wanted to install XP without losing Windows 2000, so I followed the instructions with Partition Magic very carefully and everything worked extremely well.  There were a couple of minor glitches, but overall things went much better than I expected.  This is a good product, but it is not for the novice. You need to understand the types of partitions and all the issues involved.  There is an antimated tutorial that comes with the product and it is very well done and explains some of what you need to know before you proceed.  You also MUST create the recovery disks that are recommended.  At one point, without the diskettes, I would have been unable to get to one of my partitions and would have had a difficult time getting that partition back.  Also backup is recommended, as is checking your disk for errors.  If you dont follow the instructions very carefully and understand what you are doing, I can easily see where you could end up with a big mess on your hands.  You may need to know how to change your BIOS settings too, in order to boot from a CD, if the OS you are trying to install is on a CD.  While a novice might get through it all, this tool is definately better used by those who understand how to install operating systems and how disks are structured and partitioned.  I suspect that some exotic configurations with odd disks or operating systems could easily be trashed by this product.  Its very powerful and I am extremely pleased that it did what it claimed to be able to do, on my system.  Again, if you decide to buy this, it is very important that you read the documentation, view the tutorial and understand what the product is doing and what you are doing.  One downside that I encountered is that my USB2 drive is apparently not supported, as PM shows it as BAD, even though the documentation says it supports USB2.  Dont buy it with expectations that it will work on a USB drive.  I have to say that Symantec has a way of dumbingdown some of their products to the point that they arent as good anymore as when they were owned by other companies.  Although I dont have experience with prior versions of Partition Magic, I do have experience with a couple other products that they bought from other companies.  Their versions just dont measure up to the originals.  Symantec often gets beat up for poor products, but I think it is partly because thier products are in such wide use.  You cant cover every quirky system out there and the more widely your product is used, the more potential problems.  For me, it is a lovehate relationship I cant live with them and I cant live without them."},

My mother used to do these and did very well with them. I found them to be very challenging. I probably havent done any cryptograms since I was in grade school. Its possible that I had to do them in middle school or high school math, but I dont remember doing them. Before you can solve them, you have to figure out what the key is. Thats where I found it to be difficult. There are some tips in the beginning to help you get started, but after a few attempts, I lost patience and gave up. I then gave the book to my 18 year old daughter and she was able to solve the first one without much difficulty. I know we all have different gifts and talents and I can honestly say that solving cryptograms is not one of mine! I was pleased with the size of the print it made it easier to work with. There are hints in the back as well as an answer key. If youre good at these kinds of puzzles, youll probably enjoy it."},

  {"id": 2866, "content": "Aimee LeDuc Continues to Please | I was fortunate enough to discover Clara Blacks Aimee Leduc series with the first installment, Murder in the Marais, and I have purchased and read every one since, at the moment it was published.  In this instance, thanks to NetGalley, I read the twentieth book in the series ahead of the publication date and it did not disappoint.  NOTE  In my opinion, this is a series you will appreciate most if you read it chronologically.  We know early on in the series that Aimees now deceased father was a police investigator who left the force under a serious cloud.  He raised Aimee after her radical American mother deserted them.  Each mystery takes place in a different section arrondissement or recognizable neighborhood of Paris.  Aimees friend and colleague Rene, a Little Person with serious self defense skills and advanced computer capabilities is featured in every book.  Black writes in a spare manner, but conveys the atmosphere of Paristhe particular section that is the focus of the book, characters backstories, personalities, dreams and motivations, and the plot itself brilliantly.  All twenty books are at least four stars, some five star reads.  Murder at the Porte de Versailles opens with Aimees daughter Chloes third birthday party.  Chloe naturally changes the trajectory of the series as Aimee has to consider her in her risk taking, but when her dear friend Boris is seriously injured in bombing of the police lab, she sometimes forgets to put Chloe first.  Because by nature, Aimee has to take risks and is passionate about her work.  Throughout each book, Black uses a few French words and phrases, adding to the feeling of being in France and to the context in which Aimee operates.  She is a croissant and espresso breakfast person, a person who will buy thrift store Chanel over fast fashion, politically aware ... of French politics.  I love this.  Unaccountably, there is evidence that Boris had something to do with the bombing.  This series starts in 1999 and we have just reached 2001 in Murder at the Porte de Versailles.  911 is on everyones minds when there is destruction like this.  Paris and France are full of Iranians.  There is still interest in finding activists from the 1980s who committed acts of terrorism.  Rene and Aimee and their employee Saj, using 2001 technology and oldfashioned detective skills, set out to clear Boris.  Black gives us wonderful characters and places us in Paris in every book.  This is no exception.  I loved teenager Hugo, who captured information on video, his grandfather who is loopy and not terribly honorable, Boriss partner who is convinced he was cheating, and others I wont mention for fear of spoilers.  I highly recommend the whole series, including this book."},

  {"id": 2871, "content": "Stick to it.  Good Book | NOTE  As I slogged through the first chapter of this novel, I was so bored and unimpressed by the writing I almost put it down.  This is because Eldridge felt a need to spend a full chapter introducing us to the team of Daniel Wilson and Abigail Fenton, the Museum Detectives in a purely unnecessary and plodding way.  With his extensive writing experience,. he should do more integration of his characters past and present relationship, successes and plans because he only kept me because I requested this book on Netgalley and am committed to writing reviews  for the books I receive there.  Next time, dont do this!  Yes, give us the info we need to follow the tale and sell the earlier books, but not in one boring dose at the beginning and as subtly as possible.  Heads up to the editors! BUT  After that first chapter, this was a totally enjoyable read, set in 1897 White Chapel about eight or nine years after Jack the Ripper was active.  In fact, Wilson is a former officer who worked on the Ripper case.  Abigail is an Egyptologist.  They are called in by the National Gallerys curator because a prostitute was found dead on the museum steps, mutilated much the way the Rippers victims were.  Walter Sickert, a successful artist who in recent years has come up in various theories as possibly being Jack the Ripper is accused of this murder.  His alibi is weak.  His wife is about to divorce him for constant philandering and he is not wellliked about town.  Eldredge gives us several murders, a look into Sickerts personal life, an entertaining plot with several red herrings and a likable couple of detectives.  The resolution was kind of predictable but not certain and there were plenty of twists."},

  {"id": 2883, "content": "I Finished It in Two Days, Because It Was A Great Read! | When I did have to stop reading this book over the past 48 hours, I could hardly wait to get back to it!  I enjoyed Melissas memories about the different episodes. On reading about the May We Make Them Proud episode, I found it interesting that both Melissa and I agreed that if a mother was by her babys cradle and a fire started, she would GRAB THE BABY as she tried to point out to Landon during filming!That was a L.H. that I remember as being very dark and quite frightening,as I was 9 years old back in 1979.   Anyway, this book was like a walk down memory lane in the 70s, with the songs that Melissa listened to, the clothing and hairstyles, and of course the memories about Little House! I liked the fact that the title was true to the books contents. When I read Prairie Tale by Melissa Gilbert, I thought it would have many more details about her L.H. experiences, as the title suggests. I ended up forcing myself to finish it, after wading through the VERY sordid details of her many romances. Way too detailed, in my opinion! The Way I See It was not written as a tellall book. Melissa came across to me as a rather shy, gentle person who wanted to share her memories of this particular period in her life with her fans. She seems to be a person I could sit across from and enjoy sharing 70s memories and mom stories with, since her son is exactly one year and nine days older than my son!   I highly recommend this book to any Little House fan, especially those who grew up with the show in the 70s like I did. Great job, Melissa! I enjoyed your book thoroughly and will read it more than once, I guarantee!"},

Id be able to connect to router only for it to crash a few seconds later, rebooted over and over with the same thing happening. There is no eithernet plugin for this laptop as it is very thin. I think they still could of added one but maybe they were trying to cut cost and weight. I have a USB to eithernet so I was able to use that and the serial number on the back to access the latest wireless drivers on the dell site. After updating and rebooting I had no more issues with the wireless network card. If you dont have a USB to eithernet adapter youll need a USB flash drive and another computer to get the updated drivers to this system.  After the hour of troubleshooting and fixing the issue I was able to finally test the system. I had no issues installing all my core software apps MS office, Adobe PS CS5, Adobe Acrobate, and other misc apps. Hard drive seems to be a bit small but everything has gone cloud these days so I dont really see a need for a larger hard drive. Graphics are quite good. As good if not better than my work laptops that cost much more. Touch screen is accurate but I really dont think I could ever use this as a tablet as Im not very impressed with MS OS for tablet use. Over all a solid 4 start laptop 5 if I hadnt had the wireless NIC issues if you can find for 450. Currently selling for 499. And I think that is just a bit hig.

Coaxial Cable isnt cheap, but its an excellent antenna.  On my older 40 Samsung Smart TV, the antenna recognizes 48 free HDTV broadcast stations many are local advertising channels, of course when set up in my downstairs living room.  Most of the broadcast channels display clear, nonpixelated pictures.  This is better performance than my previous favorite antenna not amplified which brought in about 43 stations with many pixelated displays, when set up in an upstairs bedroom with an old 26 digitalanalog TV.  Because I live in a hilly area, upstairs is a far, far better location for any indoor antenna in my condo.  I was surprised that this antenna gets the San Jose NBC channel that is 51 miles away across many hillsthe other antenna didnt pick up that channel at all.  The signal meter, which shows 13 toprow LED lights to indicate weak, good, or strong signals for each channel, is very useful for finding the best position and orientation of the antenna in a room.

There are several different types of these  I have pretty ones and these  which are very, how shall we say, very utilitarian  nothing fancy.  Brushed silver metal.  No sparkle or cute shape. This order contains 6 pieces, 3 in each bag. You can buy individually as well.  The new, updated style is a lot better designed and offers much, much stronger magnets.  I have worn these on a lot of different material tops, thick, thin, smooth, silky, thermal, sweatshirts.. and all with secure success.  I have tried the leash type of reader holders but I hate the string around my neck  plus your glasses dangle over what your working on  or become like a bib when eating.  I am a woman so placing the magnet holder in the right spot is a consideration but I have found the perfect spot for me.  If you havent tried this version, I encourage you to try them.  This particular style has TWO strong magnets, one on each end.  They do offer this version with sparkly dots and in gold tones if you prefer.  I wanted just a simple, plain version I already have some cutesy versions and these are definitely plain and simple  great for every day use.  I have found the magnets are so strong you use them on scarves and other neck treatments if youd like.  I have even used on a thin wool ruana  worked perfectly to hold the ruana in place all day.

Predictably, I was overjoyed when I was offered the chance to review the New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes A Day, featuring many more photos, new recipes including a whole chapter on glutenfree dough, and updated information.  Youll now find revised proofing times, updated equipment guides I recently purchased a ASINB00DQCC282 Emile Henry Red Bread Cloche so I was pleased to see new instructions for proofing and baking in clay bakers or a covered castiron pot. Like any baking book worth its salt, recipes are given in volume, weight, and metric measurements. New and appreciated additions include Crock Pot Bread, Wurzelbrot Swiss Twisted Bread, Wisconsin beer cheese bread, and some muchneeded glutenfree loaves such as sweet brioche and fruitandnut spiral rolls. The new stepbystep photos for many of the loaves are a huge help in properly shaping and assembling the more intricate loaves. For those looking for a caloric splurge, the book does sinful things with enriched doughs the caramel pecan rolls are the best Ive ever tried  made I usually use the noknead brioche dough as the base and double the topping  filling to make two pans the chocolate raisin babka has 16 egg yolks. And like its predecessor, youll find dishes that pair well with various breads, including a Portuguese fish stew, Tuscan white bean dip, kebabs, and a chilled Moroccanstyle gazpacho.  If youre new to breadmaking, I would definitely recommend upgrading to the New Artisan Bread in Five, but if youve been a longtime baker from the first edition and are already comfortable with the basic doughs and instructions, you may want to look at one of their other books like ASIN0312649940 Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in Five Minutes a Day."},

  {"id": 2928, "content": "Decent printer, but can be difficult to set up.  Ink is too expensive. | Stylish and attractive with a somewhat small footprint and reasonably quiet operation.  It is not really fast printing, but adequate.  Printing starts right away, which was not the case with one printer that I own that takes forever to start printing.  Making a copy is very easy just put your page face down on the glass and press the copy button.  Unfortunately, there is no sheet feeder for copying or scanning multiple pages, so it is a page at a time.  If you do a lot of page scanning or copying, you need a printer with a sheet feeder, but you will pay a lot more for that convenience.  There is no button on the printer panel to use to scan a document you have to use software for that.  The driver for the printer, scanning software and manual must be downloaded from a website given in the instructions.  It makes some sense to me not to have the software included, as these things change over time and having it online ensures you get the latest version when you install but that does make a little more difficult for the novice.  Also until you download and check the users guide, you really dont have a clue on how to scan.  The software installs a program simply called 34scanning34 on your Windows PC and you run that to scan.  One of the first things I did not like about this printer is that there are only two ink cartridges one for black and one for color.  I have never liked that because if you run out of just one color, you have to replace the whole color cartridge.  The printer has an 34ECO34 button you can press that puts out less ink to help you save on ink when you dont need the very best quality, so thats something that can help save on ink.  The ink is a very pricey, so not sure this would be as economical as printers that have 4 or more ink cartridges  This only has color and black and the cartridges shipped with the printer did not last very long..  If you want to use this on USB, rather than wireless, a USB cable is not included, so if you dont have a spare around, you have to buy one.  After you download the software, you have to run it and apparently connect a USB cable initially, even if you are going to use it wireless.  You are given a choice in the install as to whether you want to go wireless or with USB.  On one computer I had trouble with either option it kept telling me to attach a USB cable that was already attached.  I investigated and found out that the printer was showing up in Windows and I could use it with USB.  As far as wireless, there are two options either with a WPS button or manual where you enter your router information.  On one computer, neither option worked, even after multiple attempts I could not get wireless to work at all.  I tried connecting the printer to another computer and both the USB option and the manual setup for wireless worked perfectly on the first try.  I could not get the WPS option to work, even on the second computer.  Since the manual setup worked, I didnt need to.  If you dont know, WPS is a button you press on your router and then you press a button on the printer within two minutes and it is supposed to connect automatically.  Was going to contact support about the wireless problem, but since I got it working with manual settings on one computer, I didnt call.  If you are not somewhat computer literate, this is not the best printer for you to try to set up you might struggle with it for a while.  This printer also is supposed to be able to scan remotely with your smartphone with a free app that you can download from the app store, but I did not test that capability, as it seemed to me to be of limited value."},
  {"id": 2929, "content": "Salt lamp bowl | I purchased two of these for my tiny AZ home... one for the master bedroom and one for the livingdining area.  I have never purchased a salt lamp before and I cannot speak to the list of possible benefits, but I am hopeful for positive results.  However, having said that, the lamp is lovely.  The dimmer switch is very nice.  You can control the brightest easily using the dimmer switch which clearly changes the mood.  The salt chunks are large and each chunk is unique in color and size and shape as you can imagine.  The bowl holder is a clear acrylic type material... about 834 in diameter  just eye balling it... and about 634 tall.  It came very carefully and beautifully packaged.  Once you put the salt in the bowl I can image that you dont want to move them around a lot as it could scratch the bowl.  I did carefully move a few pieces to places I felt were better.  I have had the lamps plugged in for about 8 hours... no odors.  Just a really beautiful glow.  The dimmer switch is hard.  You just tap it to turn it on or off and gently press to dim or brighten. There is a very nice booklet with instructions on how to change the bulb a spare is provided Cleaning instructions say regularly dust salt crystals with a dry, clean cloth. Do not wash or clean with water or detergents, If not in use for a long period of time, store the lamp in a cool, dry environment, covering the crystals with a plastic bag.  The lamp may naturally moisten in humid environments  saying further that if you use in a humid environment leave the lamp on for several hours to naturally dry out Im thinking like in a bathroom? They also note not to place to close to electronics as the salt may draw moisture.  It says if the salt crystals become moist  gently pat down with a clean dry cloth  also noting not to clean the bowl with any organic or other solvents or it may become damaged. I would say if youre looking to purchase one of these as a gift, they are beautifully packaged and look very high end. The price is definitely higher than some of the options but not the highest. I personally chose the bowl style of salt crystal because salt may draw moisture and I wanted it contained instead of dripping off a free standing rock without containment. I do really love the soft glow. That alone is worth the purchase to me.  I do really hope the claimed health benefits will be a bonus. I never hesitate to update my reviews if new info should seem useful.  I also try to answer all questions to best of my ability. Hope this helps you in your decision. UPDATE  2102017.... I have been using both lamps 247 for some weeks now.  Both are still working perfectly.  I still believe these salt lamps are a really good buy. Ive looked at so many in person that were so much more money and so much less lamp.  I think one of the best parts is the dimming light.  You can really adjust to comfort, for instance, in the bedroom.  Still feel these lamps are really 5 star items."},

  {"id": 2941, "content": "A sleeper of astonishing colour and beauty | The Man Who Cried is a feast for the eyes and ears alike. One recent review called it the arthouse companion to Moulin Rouge, and that doesnt seem too far off. The film begins with Fegele and her father in 1927 Russia, with a beautifully photographed game of hide and seek. Fearing for his familys safety, her father sends her away to America, but Fegele ends up in England by mistake, is renamed Suzie and is raised by a grim British couple. The scenes of the Russian shtetl are grim, and colour truly doesnt become pronounced until we see the cabaret shows of Paris, the gaudy costumes and headdresses and the opera sets. Suzie Christina Ricci runs into fellow showgirl Lola Cate Blanchett and the two room together, locking horns over Italian sensation Dante, the main draw at the theatre, who also happens to be a fascist. Lola gets her way and her man. Enter one very mysterious, brooding Gypsy horseman Johnny Depp, reprising his role from Chocolat who captures Suzies heart. This entire whirlwind of music, passion and drama occurs on the eve of World War Two, and Suzie is in danger of being discovered as Jewish. The cinematography is gorgeous, with washedout colours in Russia, beautiful cityscapes of Paris especially the bikehorse chase at night!, gaudily bright costumes and opera sets, the exotic colour, music and flair of the Gypsy camp and costumes. The colour brings to mind the brilliant Technicolour prints of the earlier days, with vibrant, surreal colours. The soundtrack is equally stunning, with contributions by newcomer Italian tenor Salvatore Licitra, the Kronos Quartet, the Gypsy ensemble Taraf de Haidouks, and Czech songstress Iva Bittova providing the voice for Christina Ricci. The operatic selections by Bizet, Puccini, Purcell, and Verdi are balanced by original score the stunning Close Your Eyes is the most beautiful song in the movie and frantic Gypsy music. Bittovas Gloomy Sunday is a delightful study in atmosphere, and appropriately sets the tone for an onscreen event near the end of the film. The Man Who Cried is an unusual, beautiful, and touching glimpse at a decadent Europe on the brink of war, the vibrant Gypsy culture, the Jewish shtetls of Russia, and the world of opera, all intertwined with romance and connections to the past."},

Now, they can bring their dirty clothes, sort them, and then take their hampers back to their rooms. We do go through a lot of dirty clothes, so it doesnt take long for these bags to fill up.

It took my husband about half an hour to put this together one night while watching TV. All the pieces were there and it was fairly simple. Theres a netboard that goes on the bottom of the cart which my husband didnt notice until he had put it all together, so he did have to take off the the bars on the sides to slip that into place. I keep the cart in the laundry room and just take out the clothes from the bag. You could actually lift the bag and dump it into the machine if you wanted to. The wheels feel secure and the cart moves well. I wheel it out into the kitchen for the kids to sort their dirty clothes then I wheel it back into the laundry room.

I am happy to pay more if it does what I am expecting. The point of having wifi is to sync data even when your phone is not with you at the time or out of range, and probably sync faster. The problem is, this scale DOES NOT sync over wifi, period. It keeps asking for a bluetooth connection to function. This is after the latest firmware upgrade.  Another surprise it the APP actually have online support chat function, and it is actually connected me with a online person, but the dude have NO idea what he is talking about and keep saying you need a bluetooth to sync data, but he cant answer one simple question, what is the point of equipping the device with a WIFI?  The APP itself is a bummer it seems designed as a all home smart device this company makes, it complicated the interface. After I added this device and profile, and EVERY time I click on the device, it asks me Male or Female blah  blah ... seem have no memory I just put in this info and I signed up already. It is extremely confusing. If you cant get me going on this single ONE product of yours, what is the point of designing one trying to include all?  bottom line, I had high expectation, but end up very disappointed."},

Its not the best quality for the price.  There is only one speed and it goes kind of fast on the  younger spectrum of the age recommendation.  Its a cute toy and my gson loves it.

I have been SO happy with my choice, I really thought my Mom would too  I was right!  The really awesome part is that Corelle is super tough, and yet, LIGHT.  They dont stain.  They are just about bullet proof and yet really nice in style and size. There are also a LOT of really pretty designs and this one has my Moms favorite flower, the iris on it.  The color is a soft purple.  The bowls are squarish... as are the plates, with soft edges.  The cups are lovely for tea or coffee.  The micro and go into the dishwasher easily. If you are interested in this pattern there are quite a lot of additional pieces available  this is one of their more popular prints.  Honestly, there is no better choice if you want durability AND light weight dishes.  I love these and the ones I bought for myself.

There are 4 positions, one of which is the peg being completely removed.  They should have made a spare hole to store the peg.  The top cushions are also adjustable which will be great for taller people.  The board itself is stationary.  The bench feels sturdy when on it but its not a heavy bench.  The bench does fold down but now completely flat.  The headrest is a great addition for taller people.  Again, Im only 5 even so my head wasnt even close to it.

There are plenty of tempting veggies as well, along with soups and salads. Desserts range from poached fruit to tiramisu, layered mocha torte, and a panetonne pudding.

  {"id": 3026, "content": "Fantastic baking book youll want to own! | Some of my earliest food memories revolve around the smell and taste of the fresh yeast bread my Polish grandmother would bake in her small apartment kitchen in Michiganfor me, there is no more comforting aroma than that of freshlybaked bread. In a sort of alchemy, humble ingredients are transformed into an expression of baking talent and love. Ive lived in five countries and visited several others, and sampling local breads and baked goods is one of the first things I set out to do.  My large baking collection features numerous books on breads and baking, including several editions of the seminal The Italian Baker by Carol Field, my staple Artisan Bread in 5, Crumb A Baking Book, Honey  Co The Baking Book, and the new Breaking Breads A New World of Israeli BakingFlatbreads, Stuffed Breads, Challahs, Cookies, and the Legendary Chocolate Babka, and Im pleased to report that Panetteria Gennaros Italian Bakery now holds a spot of honor as well.  Gennaro Contaldo, Italian chef and restauranteur who mentored Jamie Oliver, grew up surrounded by a family of bakers, from spending hours in his uncles bakery to waking up to his mothers home baking. As a baker at The Neal Street Restaurant, he was responsible for making the bread, focaccia, torte salate, pastry and seasonal bakes. As he mentioned in the foreword, bread and baked goods mean tradition, and youll find various bakes from across Italy and in honor of various seasons and holidays.  Beginning with basic bread dough and grissini, youll find recipes for panini, stuffed breads, focaccia garlic and rosemary, cheese, peppers, potato, red onion and pancetta, pizze Bianca, marinara, 4cheese, greens, individual pizzas, stuffed pies spinach, guanciale, courgette and ricotta, sweet breads plaited sweetbread, aniseed and currant ring cake, pandoro, brioche, colomba, crostate tarts ricotta and Nutella, dried apricot, strawberry and peach, creamy limoncello tart with grated chocolate, pumpkin, biscotti, cantucci, and torte pear and chocolate, polenta and almond cake, yogurt and orange ring cake, marbled espresso loaf cake. Many of the recipes are influenced by Tuscany including autumnal favorite castagnaccio, and youll note that some recipes do not include salt as is traditional  so you may choose to add at your own discretion. Ingredients are listed in metric as well as US volume and weight measurements, a thoughtful touch that makes it much easier for US bakers. And many recipes feature gorgeous matte photographs of the final bakes.  For this review, I made three recipes, including the grape and rosemary buns, tricolor braided loaf, and the aniseed and currant cake.  The grape and rosemary buns did not include salt in the recipe, and I would definitely add about  tsp next time as the sweetness of the grapes could use the balance from a pinch of salt. Also, the shaping instructions were rather vague form the dough into little basket shapes and I must have rolled mine too tightly as I could not get my dough spirals to resemble the photo, but they were delicious nonetheless and froze beautifully.  The second recipe I tried was the treccia colorata, with three different flavors saffron walnut, rum raisin, chocolate and orange. This was extremely timeconsuming start to finish, it was a fourhour project and messy, and I felt like I may have overworked the dough trying to knead in the cocoa powder after the first rise  next time, I would add in the flavoring during the initial mixing  kneading by dividing the dough before the first rise. The final loaf was a touch dry, but made fantastic toast and looked gorgeous on the table.  The final recipe and my personal favorite of the three was the aniseed and currant ring cake. I was happily surprised to find both currants and Sambuca widely available here in Japan, and set out to make the cake I used a 10cup NordicWare Bundt pan. This was the easiest recipe of the three, and very easy to assemble it only requires a brief knead. The final texture was delightfully soft, fragrant, and makes fantastic toast.  My next challenge will be the chestnut squares as chestnuts are in season here in Japan in fact, one of my former students gifted me with some gorgeous chestnuts from his tree, so I look forward to baking with them.  Overall, Panetteria Gennaros Italian Bakery is a delightful addition to your baking library that fans of Italian breads and pastries will definitely want to own!"},

For this purpose, the 20X magnification is perfect.  To use this mirror, you need to hold it close to your eyes and look straight into it.  Otherwise you cant see a focused image.

  {"id": 3074, "content": "A great intro to the kitchen, whether youre young or old | I just bought Anyone Can Cook for a recentlyretired family member whos as unfamiliar around the kitchen as I am in an auto shop. I wanted something with a solid foundation and ample descriptions of basics such as choosing, storing, and prepping fruits and veggies a step which is often overlooked in regular cookbooks, a primer on kitchen tools knives, utensils, appliances, and stepbystep guidance in addition to easytoprepare recipes. The first hundred pages or so are devoted to the differences between produce and tool tips red, yellow or white onions? Cremini, enoki, button, morel, or portabello mushrooms? Springform or cake pan?. Also, recipes are ranked according to skill level, with 1 being easiest and 3 being easy.  Enter Better Homes and Gardens Anyone Can Cook. Like millions of other housewives, I grew up using the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook, and have several reincarnations, so I had no reservations about investing in Anyone Can Cook. Its organization is similar to the traditional BHG cookbook i.e., appetizers, soups, salads, meats including detailed charts of the various cuts, poultry, veggies, desserts, breakfast and more. However, many of the recipes are simplified and rely heavily on storebought shortcuts such as refrigerated dough and precooked meats in that respect, it reminded me of ASIN047199796X Betty Crocker Quick and Easy Cookbook 30 minutes or less to dinner Betty Crocker Books, so if youre put off by the idea of using so many processed foods in your recipes, you might want to invest in the original BHG cookbook. Of course, once you have a little more experience, you can whip up your own pasta sauce or use leftover roast to achieve the same effect with fewer preservatives.  The layout is stuffed with stepbystep photos and can be visually overwhelming at times, especially with the choice of bright colors. I noticed that several of the recipes are carryovers from other BHG publications such as ASIN0696213451 Vegetarian Cooking Better Homes  Gardens. Also, many of the recipes are ethnically influenced, including many with a LatinAsian flair. If exotic doesnt appeal to you, you might want to steer clear.  For everyone else, this is a perfect, stepbystep introduction to the kitchen, including some simple baked goods, that will allow you to graduate to more difficult standard recipes once youve mastered the basics."},

  {"id": 3078, "content": "There is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home. | Susie Fishbeins bestselling series Kosher By Design goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume Kosher By Design Brings It Home. Inspired by Susies travels to France, Italy, Mexico, Israel, and North America, youll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs, lasagna bolognaise, and shoyu tamago ramen which normally has a porkbased broth here in Japan.  I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly Including The Joy of Kosher and The New Kosher, but this was my first experience with the Kosher By Design series.  The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes, including staples like arancini fried stuffed risotto,  ravioli, Tuscan bean and farro soup, veal scallopini, brachiole, fried pizza Napolitana, ragu Napolitano, and lasagna, but youll also find Asianinspired dishes short ribs, spicy kim chee hangar steaks,  ramen, chicken adobo and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas, ceviche, and pulled beef tacos.  The salads and dairy  fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light, refreshing salads for nearly every meal, and the Israeliinspired salads here are perfect for hot, hazy days when you dont feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad, Lumina market salad, Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!, kale squash Caesar salad, root vegetable apple salad, and Chedvas warm French potato salad was a revelation baby potatoes, haricots verts, and a tangy white wineherb dressing made this memorable to make it dairy, you can add crumbled feta while warm.  Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken, Amalfi sage chicken, and mustard caper chicken, and the meat dishes include various roasts, grills, and stews pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall, while the lamb cholent cassoulet reminded me of my trip to Frances Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding, farroto, pasta frittata, and risotto, while the fish dishes really shone I loved the silanglazed salmon see photo and the showstopping citrusglazed salmon, layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka having taught many students from Georgia, Id long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susies clear instructions and the easy shakshuka topping save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs! make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.  Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter, including a beautiful and deceptively simple eggplant and tomato tart see photo, tershi and couscous Im a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard  tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before, sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce, chestnut tomato quinoa, and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweettart lemon tiramisu, Beresheet Spa Kanafe, banana, date, and pecan cake, almond bobka ring, halvah baklava, and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder. Recipes are clearly labeled as meat, dairy or pareve with some having multiple options depending on dairyfree substitutions using colorcoded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew  Ashkenazi variations chummos for hummus, seviche for ceviche, bobka for babka, etc.. I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder and the ingredients are handily in bold. Each recipe comes with a fullpage photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes main dishes in particular tend to be more elegant  upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons, turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze, and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces, but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals the eggplant and tomato tart, fish dishes, and veggie sides.  Overall, Kosher by Design Brings It Home is a wonderful finale to Susies bestselling series with nearly 500,000 books sold and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your kosher kitchen Susies headnotes introduce the reader to places and people shes encountered on her fifteenyear culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions, from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day, in Susies words, there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.  Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!"},

I found that some of the questions were a little too elementary, but most of them were fine. There was also a little paperback book with large colored bird pictures.

This one was available through a promotion, so I was able to order it at a reduced price for our review. Its a nice, small sized speaker. Every morning, my husband slips it into his pocket so he can take it with him to his car. For its size, the sound quality is more than adequate. It does get pretty loud, but at a very high volume, it does begin to distort. It was very easy to pair with my husbands Nexus phone. And he is able to listen to his podcasts while commuting to work!

I would think this makes a great gift for a coffee lover, a first time homeowner or apartment dweller.

I thought the actors did a wonderful job, especially when you consider that there were no sets, props, etc. to set the stage, so to speak.  The film was completely created via CGI, and takes viewers from the Art Deco lines of New York to the gardens of Shangrila on a quest to discover why giant robots are attacking cities around the globe. This is a film of unprecedented beauty, filled to the brim with every childs thrills dinosaurs, robots, ray guns, dirigibles, rockets, airborne battles, and more, with a dash of romance and intrigue for the grownups. Its even more amazing watching the twopart documentary Brave New World, in which we see the soundstages and blue screens, completely devoid of props, etc. except for the actors and their marks. The costumes, music, and filmmaking lovingly recall the 1930s and 1940s, from the film titles to the sweeping orchestral themes.

  {"id": 3134, "content": "Attractive Lamp good quality easy to assemble but with a couple caveats | Gorgeous lamp.  The switch on the lamp works to operate either of the two lights independently or both at the same time  Very easy to assemble.  You cant make a mistake on assembly, as the way the lamp is packed it is obvious.  There are four sections that you have simple screw together and then one Allen screw that you tighten to hold the top on Allen wrench is included.  The lamp is sufficiently heavy so that it wont easily tip over in other words, it is not a flimsy lamp.  Has a nice heavy base and sturdy column.  I almost knocked off one star on my rating due to an issue with assembly.  When you screw the sections together you have be extremely careful to line them up perfectly straight.  I didnt at first on one section and it got slightly crossthreaded and leaned slightly in one direction.  I was able to unscrew it and redo and fortunately the threads did not get damaged.  The sections fit together tightly once you line them up properly.  I did have one other minor assembly problem when putting on the shades.  There is a screwon shade holder that you remove, put on the shade and then screw it back on.  It was on so tight that when I removed it, it actually loosened up the screwin fixture holder that it attaches to and the fixture came out of the lamp.  I pushed it back in and screwed the retainer back in and then put on the shade.  No big deal, but when they assembled this at the factory, they must have tightened the shade holder too much on one side.  Since I got it together successfully without too much trouble and since it looks great, I am rating 5 stars, but just be away that if you get this, you have to be a little careful during assembly."},

It accurately and lovingly captures the thrills of childhood, of breathless anticipation, the joys of friendship,  and the final moment when we must bid our childhood goodbye and take our  place in the grownup world. The performances are flawless and capture the  original flavour of each of the characters from the book. Megan Follows IS  Anne Shirley, Shuyler Grant is a kindred Diana Barry, and Colleen Dewhurst  is the stern Marilla Cuthbert who finds her heart unexpectedly embracing  the joys of motherhood. Everything about Anne of Green Gables is done  with the utmost love and respect in regard to the original novel by Lucy  Maud Montgomery. Anne is every child, with her eyes open to the world, her  thirst for knowledge, her immediate trust, her quest for adventure, and  most of all her imagination. Megan Follows captures the timeless appeal of  the orphaned Anne with spirit, grace, and wit. Her humorous mishaps,  personal struggles, and her newfound love for the Cuthberts as well as her  love for Avonlea make her an enduring heroine throughout the ages.  Who  knows?

The number pad is mounted on an angled, clear plastic stand that makes it easy to use for inputting lots of numbers.  The keypad adds a number pad if your PC keyboard doesnt have one, or frees you from messing with the NumLock key on a PC keyboard that does. The keypad performs the standard operations , , , , and totals with the return key.  A backspace key makes it easy to correct entry mistakes on the builtin Windows calculator.

You use a remote control to do the various settings and it works well.  The brightness controls on the remote didnt seem to do that much, but all the other color choosing buttons worked, as did the ON and OFF.  I was just slightly disappointed that there was no WHITE light choice.  I was thinking of using these for lighting model railroad buildings, but white light would have been preferable.  The colored lights will probably work reasonably well.  These are really better for parties or seasonal events.  Very pleased with them.  The only issue is that the included manual is hard to read, as some of the print is dark on dark.  As it turned out, the pictures in the manual were enough to get the lights hooked up and working.

Like bad enough that you cant wear these in public. And this isnt a matter of being delusional about my size and trying to stuff my body into too small clothes. These are plus size leggings and the fabric is just bad and not thick enough. These are fine still to wear around the house or for layering under jeans since they fit close enough, but thats about it really. Knocking the rating down to 3 stars from 5.  These are exactly what I was wanting. Im 51034 and a size 1618 and they fit well. Have a big butt and thighs but they still fit well enough to be relatively high waisted on me, they are high enough to help smooth out a baby gut at least. They are long enough for me as well. The fabric is thick and feels comfortable to wear under a long top since it helps to smooth things out. If these wash well, Im going to buy a few more pairs for sure. My one complaint is that I wish the fabric was just a bit thicker so it was a tiny bit more opaque. But they are fine right now. If they shrink or dont wash well, then I will update the review."},

  {"id": 3215, "content": "The first computer game I fell in love with | Are You Afraid of the Dark The Tale of Orpheos Curse is based on the defunct Nickelodeon series Are You Afraid of the Dark? The show featured a group of kids the Midnight Society who would gather around a campfire at night to share scary stories of the supernatural. The Tale of Orpheos Curse was not a plot that was covered in any of the TV episodes.  The game tells the story of Terry and Alex, siblings who are staying with their uncle. Theres a creepy abandoned vaudeville theater across from his house, and Terry, who loves magic, wants to explore the boardedup eyesore. There are tattered posters for attractions at Orpheos Palace, such as dancing wax skeletons. As Terry searches for clues, they see ghostly shadows from inside the deserted building, and sneak in an open stage door.  Your adventure really begins once youre granted access to the rundown theater and its grimy, cobwebby secrets. You get to explore a Ripleyslike room of animal oddities some with amusing animations when you click on them and a wax museum in addition to the old dressing rooms and basement. Along the way, you hear the stories of the early performers and their sad fates at the hands of Orpheo.  The game switches between Terry and Alex, although since its first person, the only clue is in the voiceovers. The graphics are static photos much like ASINB0013M2SJ0 Myst, but are highly detailed and colorful, greatly adding to the environment. Viacom filled the game with clickables, and the environments are highly interactive, surprising for a game of this age. Instead of Full Motion Video FMV, most action is shown via slideshow. There are some genuinely creepy moments being chased by several undead monsters, for a start, but theres nothing thats truly frightening here that is, if youre not afraid of some friendly ghosts.  The game is largely inventorybased the central puzzle relies on collecting artifacts from around the theater, and once you have all of them, youre given clear instructions on what to do. The ending was satisfying and the perfect note to close the story. It is possible to die, and if you do youre restored to the moment before your accidental departure.  NOTE This is a DOS game, and in order to play it on XP or Vista, youre going to need a free DOS Emulator such as DOSBox in order to play this. It usually takes quite a bit of tinkering before older DOS games will play on modern Windows OS, so be prepared to be patient. This is still my first real video game and one of my enduring favorites for its strong story and ghostly atmosphere!  If you enjoyed The Tale of Orpheos Curse, I also recommend ASINB00005LVWM Nancy Drew The Final Scene, which also takes place in a rundown vaudeville theater and features an emphasis on magic."},

As the novel opens, Sherlock and his cousin Henry are in Wales wrapping up a case that began in India with hired thugs, but are soon called to Paris when a mysterious Opera ghost starts making demands on the new managers.  The novel is narrated by Henry, whose presence is explained in order to fill the rift created when Watson killed off Holmes in an earlier novel. Henry, a doctor, describes both Sherlocks genius and his more human failings melancholy, his nonetoohandsome appearance in ample detail. Henry and Sherlock must interview both the principal suspects Christine Daae, Carlotta, and the Vicomte de Chagny multiple times, as well as opera employees as they race to uncover the identity of the Phantom.  In many respects, Sicilianos novel is a brilliantly rewritten version of Lerouxs original ASIN0060809248 The Phantom of the Opera The Original Novel that incorporates both the strengths of the original, as well as the observant sleuthing abilities of Holmes. Sicilianos descriptions bring the cast of characters vividly to life, and his language is suitable to the historical period of the novel, full of lush details of the opulence of that bygone era. His literary version of the Phantom in particular paints a man of great intelligence and musical genius who has turned into a twisted genius capable of death and destruction, but whose deep need for love and acceptance offer a glimmer of hope for the future the ending was inspired and incharacter for Sicilianos Phantom.  The story will be at once familiar for those who, like myself, are avid fans of the Phantom. This, along with ASIN1933626046 Phantom, was one of the first Phantom novelizations that I read, and remains one of my favorites. Even as someone whos never read any Sherlock Holmes novels my familiarity of the character stems from cinematic portrayals by Basil Rathbone, Angel of the Opera is a fascinating hybrid that does justice to two literary giants."},

Its compact and doesnt take up a lot of space. It can easily slip into your pocket or purse. When I first started playing around with it, I pulled the cables unevenly which then caused them not to go back in smoothly. I looked at the product description online and found that you have to pull them out together at the same time. When you do that, they do go back in to the case smoothly. The floral image seems to be on there pretty well. Ive rubbed over it multiple times to see if it would wear off, but it hasnt so far. The charging cable works as it should and seems to be comparable in speed to others. I really need to see if I can find one that works for iPhones so I can get one for my daughter.

  {"id": 3239, "content": "Just sad.. | The book is okay.. I do think Elizabeth and Ted did love each other but after a while I think his love faded for her. I just think he kept writing her letters because he knew that she would be the only person to really stick around.. he basically used her after a while because he knew she would be dumb enough to stick around because realistically he had no one else. she even stated he was engaged to a whole other woman behind her back.. and then there were times they didnt see one another for a while.. I think he had love for her but he been fell out of love with her, he was just using her Liz as a cover up so he can look like a decent family man.. too bad she was too dumb to see it..  at one point she even said when the cops started following him around thats when Ted started hanging around her all the damn time and she even said she noticed that he was hanging out with her more but she didnt care just as long as she was getting his attention.. but Im not judging Elizabeth we were all young and in love at one point to the point where we wouldve believed anything they said.. and Ted was a very handsome charming man and hes a great liar so imagine being young and insecure and a alcoholic and you meet a master manipulator like Ted bundy ?

They are rolled onto thin, styrofoam like spools with pencil sized holes through them so it you have a pencil sized rod to thread them onto, could unroll the ribbon like a pro.  The ribbon itself is pretty thin... its not super quality.. BUT the price is fair in my opinion.  I use the ribbon to wrap around candy bars I bring onto the plane for the crew when I travel.  So... it doesnt have to be super sturdy.  The colors are bright and cheery.  The first one I untaped at the edge, unraveled.. so carefully remove the tape stoppers or you wont have any ribbon!   All in all I am happy with the purchase  having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful and I hope this info was helpful to you. UPDATE  92020  my second purchase....NOTE The ribbon is still rolled onto a Styrofoam core that has a hole in the center  about the circumference of a pencil ...  It is really important  for ease of use that you keep it on the Styrofoam core. If you accidentally have the ribbon fall off the core  its a mess that you will end up rewinding.

Weve knocked over our dish before and it made a huge mess. So that is a definite plus with this. Since this arrived a few weeks ago, we havent had many fruit flies.

I love that there is a handle on the top of the table that you can easily lift each table off the stand using the handle.  They are sturdy when opened and used. The one thing that caused me to take one star away is the staining quality process.. Eh. the stain was obviously sprayed on.. and the inner handle area on a couple of the tables are kinda thin and frankly  missing... and one of the tops of the tables is   less than perfect in the staining process  with a huge dark strip  odd  looks like a strip of tape almost... but no tape.. Its rough too, while the rest of the table is smooth....but then wood is not perfect either.... eh.  The bottom line is that they are sturdy... the handle at the top of each table is super handy and the stand keeps them tidy when not in use.  note  the tables are all fully assembled...however, you will need to assemble the stand that holds the tables.

I do recommend as other reviewers to pay particular attention in carefully installing the spout... I did and had NO leaks!  They are quite large so youll need a good, deep sink.  I actually used my laundry sink cause it is even deeper than my kitchen sink.  The pieces stack inside of the main drink piece and minimize the space needed to store them.

BILB proved every bit as wonderful as my friend said, and in a nutshell is a sort of cross between Monsoon Wedding and My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Jess, a Londoner of Asian descent, plays football in secret since her parents strictly forbid it and want her to grow into a nice, traditional Sikh girl who can cook a full Punjabi dinner. Jess, however, has other plans. She teams up with Jules short for Juliet, a fellow footballer, and the team coach Joe and an American scout eagerly appraises the two. Along the way Jess has to survive her sisters frantic, bipolar engagement and wedding, come clean to her parents about her joining the team, fights over her blossoming romance, and learns to follow her heart. Jess confides her worries to her David Beckham poster that hangs over her bed. Her room is filled with Beckham memorabilia. Jules mother is similarly against her daughter playing football, convinced that she must be a lesbian since she favours sports bras, has short hair and wears boyish clothes. The two girls hang out often, finding more similarities than differences, but when Jess nearly kisses Joe, Jules is furious, having eyed him for herself, and a stony rivalry ensues. The film is doused with Indian culture, including saris, salwar kameez, samosas, Bollywood musicals, singing game shows, bhangra rock, and more, but always finds a more or less comfortable balance between Indian and London cultures. The unbelievably colourful, extravagant wedding was one of my favourite highlights of the film since I adore bhangra rock and Bollywood. The soundtrack is similarly influenced, with many Indian pop songs, and my favourite of all, The Power of Love cover Sitam version by Amar. The cinematography is at times used for comedic effect, as in rapid cutaways to see the dazedshockeddelighted expression of parents and relatives, in dizzying, rapidfire football matches, the colourful exuberance of the Indian wedding, the sizzling energy of a German nightclub, and at times timed shots to capture the beauty of day turning into dusk. The movie is blessed with a strong cast, a great story, and characters that draw you into their worlds, worries, and triumphs, not to mention a catchy soundtrack, great football action, and a tender romance. Bend It Like Beckham will certainly join my other honoured favourites such as Monsoon Wedding and My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Oh, and look for a Theres Something About Marylike singalongbloopers during the credits. If you love football, romantic comedies, andor Indian culture, you will surely score with Bend It Like Beckham."},

  {"id": 3398, "content": "rechargable salt and pepper shakers, blue light | I purchased these rechargable salt and pepper shakers because they came with a charging pad and LED lights. I have 2 rechargable shakers now that I must plug into a USB cord every few weeks  but no light. The problem with these is that the light is BLUE.  Its almost worse than NO light because the blue light is so blue you cant see where or what you are grinding!  The charge pad is handy, but youll be constantly cleaning it because your shakers sit on the charger base  at the bottoms where the salt and pepper exit.  Also, you must press the button to grind  my current shakers turn on when you flip them  there is a button but no one uses it.  Additionally, the reservoirs for the peppercorns and salt crystals are VERY small.  Eh.  Minus 2 stars for the horrible blue light and another star dock for the way they are designed with the grinder opening on the charger base.  I am searching for a better set, at the very least with a white light.  I cannot recommend this set.  Not sure what I will do with them, probably donate them.

I ended up putting this side by side with his typical ointment and figured I would try the Mountain Falls first. I loved the light fragrance on this product and it goes on easily and totally protected his skin and private part areas. My daughter in law, when picking him up Sunday night, asked me what I had been using and I shared this with her. She asked if she could take it with her for the rest of the week and I happily obliged. Getting it back more than half empty, I readily ordered another to have it here for Labor Day weekend when they are returning again.

The chapters of this book alternate between Josh, the handsome movie star and Joey, the pretty but who recently caught her fiance with her best friend. These two are set up to marry one another on a reality TV show without having met before. Then they are sequestered in a house with two other couples who also just blindly got married. Once they are in the house, it reminded me a lot of Big Brother. I found this story to be very entertaining and fast paced. I did find the alternating point of views a little confusing at times. There were a couple of occasions where I had to back track to see whose turn it was. I thought it ended a little too abruptly. I was expecting another chapter when instead it was the acknowledgements. Overall, I thought it was a fun, quick read."},

  {"id": 3439, "content": "Unparalled Protection | I have used Panda Antivirus for many years and I cant recall ever getting a virus or at least none that caused any damage.  Once in a while I will check my system with another scanner just to see if Panda is preventing viruses and it appears to be doing an excellent job.  Rarely do I ever find any viruses that are able to slip by Panda.  You wont find a better antivirus prevention program.  It also does a good job on automatic updates.  Its nonintrusive and runs quietly in the background.  The additional protection of the firewall is a plus and the firewall seems to work well too.  Generally I dont like bundled packages, but this combination seems to work flawlessly.  The firewall doesnt have much configurability, so if thats important to you, you might want to just get the antivirus product instead of the combo, but you can turn off the firewall if you want.  The real downside to Panda is that sometimes the install can be a nightmare.  I dont recall having much of an issue with the 2007 version, but some earlier versions were just horrendous.  If you can deal with a sometimes quirky install and finally get it working, the payoff is well worth the struggle.  Some of the easier to install, better known competitors just dont provide as much protection.  Something else to be aware of is that Webroot SpySweeper a popular antispyware program had some serious conflicts with Pandas scan.  This is not the fault of Panda and Webroot has corrected most of the conflicts in their current version.  There still appears to be one big conflict, but there is a workaround for it.  Pandas support can be a little spotty at times.  Sometimes I have gotten good response other times it has been a bit slow.  They always seem to respond even if it takes a while.  Since the product works so well once up and running it is rare that you would even need support most likely youll need it an install time.  If you are building a new system, install it early and you shouldnt have any issues.  As security products tend to get more comprehensive, there are a bound to be more conflicts and if you try to run multiple products you can have difficulty.  Panda seems no worse and no better than any others in that regard.  I highly recommend it even with the caveats mentioned here."},

  {"id": 3471, "content": "An excellent book on an important topic | First of all, I must note that this book dealing with childrens emotions was published by DK, a publishing company rightly noted for its superb travel books.  I love the clear, wonderful colors used in the book, and the DK logo attracted me and set up my expectations.  I was not disappointed.  That said, this is not a book you should simply give your child to read and expect him or her to understand it.  The way to approach this book is together with your child, in small increments, reading together and discussing various concepts along the way.  As I read this book, I was imagining reading it with a child and discussing it together, even acting out various imaginative scenarios.  As a retired teacher, I could imagine using this book in elementary school circle meetings, where kids discuss with an adult how to deal with some of the feelings they are having.  This book deals with positive emotions, like happiness and joy, but more to the point, it covers difficult feelings, such as anger, fear, and sadness.  I liked the fact that the book explains what is going on in our bodies as we experience these feelings, and it also gives kids an expanded vocabulary for expressing what they are experiencing.  For example, instead of I feel bad, or I feel mad, children are given words like embarrassed, jealous, guilty, stressed, and many more.  There is a wonderful section on bullying, which is approached from the POV of both the bully and the target of bullying.  The book contains all sorts of suggestions for what to do when you experience these emotions.  I only wish this sort of thing had been around when many adults were children.  It seems to me that so many of our present day problems may have been forestalled if people had had a chance when they were kids to express and deal with their negative emotions.  I give this book my highest recommendation for every parent, and every teacher as well.  The book itself is most appropriate for preschool and elementary school, but even high school teachers and parents of teens could benefit from itfor themselves, not for the kids, who would be insulted by a kiddie book but who may desperately need the lessons it teaches."},

Mom Matsuko, Dad Takashi, Grandma Shige, Noboru and Nonoko, and family dog Pochi are presented in a series of vignettes, from Matsuko and Takashis wedding complete with a dream sequence comparing marriage to a bobsled run and being tossed on stormy seas, to a forgetful day blame the ginger!, to a hilarious nighttime encounter with motorcycle punks. The animation style is very lowkey, taking its visual cues from penandink comics and a pastel wash. Less is more, as the mere outline of shoji screens and sakura cherry blossoms suffices to paint a minimalist picture of modern Japan. Poetry by Basho rounds out each clip. This is a wonderful introduction to Japanese culture, from proper dining etiquette DONT dump your rice into your soup , to Japanese homes noren, airing out futons, place settings, traditional food such as miso, tamago, and tempura, changing into slippers when entering homes wedding ceremonies, and more.   Some reviewers have mentioned that the stories lack cohesiveness, but I greatly enjoyed this unusual portrait of family life that looked at parentchild relations, marriage, salarymen, and the power of imagination. Although Disney dubbed this with an allstar cast James Belushi, David Ogden Stiers, I didnt listen to the English dub, so I cant comment on the English cast I prefer to view anime in the original Japanese with English subtitles to practice my Japanese listening comprehension. A vast departure from other Takahata Isao films like Grave of the Fireflies, but an enjoyable one nonetheless, particularly if you are already familiar with elements of Japanese culture."},

Each could stand alone, but together, they just fit.  I thought a lot about whether to give the films four or five stars. There are a lot of films which have more aspects to them.  But, are those films better? Maybe, but I just enjoyed these in different ways.  So, thats why I give Before Sunrise and Before Sunset five stars each. They just grab you. What some might criticize the films for, just make them better, in my opinion. For instance, some criticize the films as slow moving, but as I see it, I like to spend more time with people I like and want to root for.  Plus, I see a parallel between a couple building such a bond in a short time, but are questioning whether it will last, and my reaction to the films right after seeing them. My appreciation of the films just seems to grow.  Thanks, Ethan and Julie. Its hard to imagine the roles without you."},
  {"id": 3499, "content": "Heartwarming tale of the power of music and love both real and perceived | Ladies in Lavender tells the tale of two elderly sisters, Ursula Judi Dench and Janet Maggie Smith, who share an ancient cottage in Cornwall, England on the eve of WWII. One morning after a violent storm, they find a young man washed up on the beach, more dead than alive. They take him in and tend to him, quickly discovering that he speaks no English, but he speaks German and says he is Polish. The fact that he speaks German arouses local suspisions, as the villagers wonder if he could be a German spy.  Time passes quickly, and Andrea SpanishGerman Daniel Bruhl, better known for 2003s Good Bye, Lenin! quickly proves his talent with the violin. Matters are complicated when both of the sisters fall for Andrea. The tender, naive Ursula seems to have never had a beau, and despite the great age difference between her and Andrea, clearly is pondering a sexual relationship with him. Janet tries to rein her in, to no effect.  A mysterious, beautiful stranger named Olga is also a newcomer to the village. Although she, too, speaks German and French, she is Russian, sister of the famous violin virtuoso Boris Danilof. This important information is withheld from Andrea, as the sisters strive to keep him for themselves, but Andrea is miserable at having his career as a concert violinist kept at arms length. He begins to spend more and more time with Olga, to the distaste of Ursula and Janet, and in a fateful conversation, he is told of Olgas identity and of her famous brother, who wants to meet Andrea. His conscience torments him at having to make the choice between leaving the kindhearted sisters and seizing his rightful place in the concert halls of the world.  Ursulas childish love affair with Andrea is heartbreaking. She asks Janet about her dead beau several times, asking if you really loved him. Janet catches Ursula in Andreas room at night, touching him while he is asleep. And in a brief dream sequence, we see Ursula as a young woman, rolling about in the fields with Andrea. She is so fragile, so naive, and heartbroken when Andrea ultimately makes his choice, that Judi Denchs performance can be hard to watch in these scenes.  Beautiful cinematography of Cornwall, a gorgeous soundtrack with virtuoso Joshua Bell, two legends of British theater, and a strong supporting cast makes Ladies in Lavender another example of why British cinema is some of the best out there. Fans of The Red Violin and musicalhistorical dramas will do well to check out Ladies in Lavender."},

  {"id": 3502, "content": "Nice quick refresher for the beach going pooch | I need to start by stating I live in sunny Florida, a few miles from the beach. I take my dog regularly to the beach to run and play in the water and the sand. Typically, when she is done, I use the little shower device on the outskirts of the beach area to rinse her off. But I know she is not really clean and hours later I can still smell the beachy dog and end up giving her a bath. With these grooming wipes in hand, I run it over her after she has been rinsed and towel dried and I noticed an immediate improvement. The scent is lovely and it seems to stay with her. Although I will probably regularly have to wash her anyway, these wipes, in a pinch do the job to keep her fresh smelling. I keep them in my glove compartment. As someone else mentioned here, it would be nicer if they were a little larger. My dog is a 38 lb. midsized dog and I need to use at least 23 of these per use."},
  {"id": 3503, "content": "Somewhat difficult to start up | I am rewriting this review since I returned my earlier purchase which did not work  same model and brand and exchanged it for a new one, hoping it was some sort of mechanical defect or broken part. It seems I may have been right though I am not entirely certain.  The first one just would not work at all. The second one took about as much coaxing as the first, but it did, in the end, start working. I almost couldnt believe my eyes after my titanic battle which I lost to get the first one running. I was all but convinced theyd designed a filter that does absolutely nothing.  If you want a filter thats easy to start just plug it in and go then dont get this one by any means. The filtration quality is decent for the tank sizes it is recommended for, though for divided tanks, I would recommend having a separate filter for each section. The blue part of the filter the thing you replace seems far superior quality to some other filters I have used for smaller tanks. This system also has a component that does NOT need replacing some kind of BIOfilter where bacteria is intended to grow, I believe. You may notice some WalMart brand activated carbon on the shelves near these  dont buy it. The packaging seems to indicate the carbon is a necessary component, when in fact it is contained inside the blue filter cartridge. The only way you could use it is to buy a mediamesh bag and fill it with carbon, then slide it down inside the filter somewhere.  Another reviewer posted that they have to reset the filter every time the power goes off, and I can attest to that. The only tip I can give for how to get this thing to reliably start up has something to do with the impeller and its assembly. I found that you can pull the assembly up a little bit by putting your finger under the assembly more in the center of the reservoir as opposed to the sides  in between the biofilter and the cartridge. Thats the only decent place to lift up on it. When you lift up with it already primed and then plugged in you will hear a grinding  as soon as you hear this, shove the whole assembly back down, hard. I think one of the impeller components can spin freely when its not supposed to not the impeller itself, but something else. This jamming action seems to have jammed that component into its proper place since as soon as I did that, it started working. This must be done EVERY single time the power goes off or you unplug it.  Note When working, it does take about 20 seconds for the filter to work up to full capacity with water spewing out at the normal rate. Apparently it can also be baffled by moving the intake tube up and down. However, I am unwilling to try this due to the touchy nature of the impeller assembly. I just know that if I do, it will stop working and Ill have to get it started again.  Overall, Im not sure its worth the hassle, but based on some other reviews, and for the price, it is a fairly good filter."},

  {"id": 3518, "content": "Make your home into a vampirefree zone! | For years, I used my ASINB00004OCJX OXO Good Grips Garlic Press on a weekly basis until one sad day, the metal hinge broke right across the top. Because of the design flaw other reviewers have had the exact same experience with the metal buckling, I wanted a replacement that didnt have the hinge at a pressure point. I also didnt want something like Zylisss ASINB00004T14B Zyliss Susi DeLuxe Garlic Press, where the paint comes off on your garlic.  I narrowed down my choices to the ASINB000063Y8F Roumlsle Garlic Press garlic press and the Kuhn Rikon, both designed in Switzerland and manufactured in where else?!? China. Both are made of stainless steel and are dishwasher safe. I tried out the Rosle at a WilliamsSonoma and was unimpressed by the lightweight feel of the handles, so I took my chances with the Kuhn Rikon rated best garlic press by the illustrious Cooks Illustrated. The handles are also ergonomic and great for arthritis suffers like myself. At more than twice the cost of my old press, it was a lot more than I wanted to spend, but I also didnt want to throw away money on a cheap model that Id end up replacing sooner rather than later.  I took it for a test drive on some particularly large cloves of garlic. The Epicurean demolished it on the first squeeze, and rather messily, I might add. Remember those slomo videos of a bullet going through an apple? Imagine all those little garlic particles spraying all over your stove. You get the picture. I aimed a little more carefully on the second clove, and voila. The press literally used up 99 of the garlic clove, unlike my previous Oxo, which would leave about 30 still intact. The swinging basket design makes cleanup a breeze no tool is included, but you just need to dig out the remains with a fingernail or toothpick and rinse. Its dishwashersafe and has a lifetime warranty. Although its probably the priciest kitchen utensil Ive invested in, I use a lot of fresh garlic and need something that can live up to the hype."},

Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! This is a compact device that really packs a punch. Takes about 30 seconds to heat up but when it does it helps me keep my skin and pores clean and refreshed.

Its pocketsized about 6 long, 4 wide, provides good magnification, and comes with both a minitripod and a smartphone mount.  The magnification is quite good.  The little telescope is great for handheld viewing of nearby objects of interest.  The focus wheel works smoothly, and it is positioned to be very easy to use.  Youll probably want to use a tripod for taking smartphone photos though I took some decent photos without one.  The photos are pretty good, even if all you do is point, focus looking at the smartphone display, and shoot.  You wont be taking prizewinning nature photos with this monocular telescope, but the photos are fine for documenting a trip or other interesting sightings.  In the attached photos, the tree closeup shows the tree seen in the top center of the second photo which was taken from the same spot with the smartphone camera alone.  The tree closeup appears more sharply focused in my camera gallery than it does here on Amazon some of the detail was dropped during Amazons processing.  MOUNTING NOTES  The telescope doesnt come with instructions for assembling the smartphone mount, or for attaching the telescope to the tripod see the product page for these.  Note that the little projection on the telescope actually a loop for attaching a lanyard can be unscrewed to reveal a threaded hole for attaching the tripod.  Also, note that the smartphone mount uses a threaded piece a round cap with a threaded hole that screws onto the flat positioning bar that allows you to adjust the position of your smartphone and its camera lens. Its easy to overlook the caps fine threads.  The round cap piece fits over the viewer end of the telescope to hold the smartphone clamped in the mounts pullout jaws.  The mount worked fine with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and I didnt even have to take the phone out of its Otterbox Symmetry case."},

  {"id": 3637, "content": "Amazing soul done to perfection | I first heard about Sharon Jones and the DapKings on NPR and CNN. I was surprised to hear that they were Amy Winehouses touring band in retrospect, I should have ditched the Winehouse CD and bought 100 Days, 100 Nights since Sharon Jones and the DapKings are the enduring soul stars on the scene. Sharons story is a ragstoriches tale of a former corrections officer who gave up her goal of a solo career because she was told she was too black or too fat to succeed.  This is soul the way it used to sound gutteral, saucy, and sassy, at times a hairs breadth away from gospel, spiced with Muscle Shoalsstyle horns and tambourine beats that bring to mind the Funk Brothers. This sounds like it could be right out of the 70s heyday, and the band uses analog recording equipment for a more authentic sound.  The ten songs start out with a bang on 100 Days 100 Nights, starting with Sharon musing on love with a hoarse, urgent delivery that slows down to a slow burn as a Hammond organ underscores the drama and a gospelish choir sings the title lyrics behind Sharon. Nobodys Baby is a selfempowerment ode to women that flirts with funk and brims with dont mess with me attitude. Tell Me sounds straight out of the Funk Brothers catalog, with staccato tamborine, bongos, and crisp snare smoothed with vibe, and Sharons sassy search for love. When the Other Foot Drops, Uncle is a soundalike for a longlost Al Green gem. The rest of the tracks are each distinct and at once familiarly comforting, closing with the gospel blockbuster Answer Me.  Run, dont walk, to buy this if youre a fan of 70s soul. Amazing performances and authentically retro sound make this a musthave."},

  {"id": 3648, "content": "The charger works but its a little loose | I only took off one star because the charger works but it fits a little loose for some reason??? I looked up this because I lost the one I initially got with the product itself and couldnt find which one was the original so to speak, I assumed it was this one because the other one option looked very different. It does fit and does work and charge okay but for some reason it is a loose fit when you connect it to the scrub itself? It almost feels as if you just put it on top of it like it could come off at any moment but it did charge the battery so I guess thats what matters."},

We have several pairs of gardening gloves, but they are either too large for me my husbands or too small my daughters. This pair is all mine! The size large fits my hands well. They are not too tight nor are they loose. They are easy to put on and adjust. The Velcro closure keeps them in place when in use. The palm side reminds me of a thin, leather like material. Dirt brushes off it pretty well. They are thick enough that they protect your hands from thorns and branches. They arent cumbersome and do not get in the way when you are working. I am very pleased with these.  I received these for free in exchange for my honest amp unbiased review. My thoughts amp opinions are my own."},
  {"id": 3652, "content": "Great Hardboiled Detective Best so far of a Great Series | Im loving the Archer series, with the third entry confirming that David Baldacci has successfully nailed the hard boiled detective genre.  When visiting his friend and aspiring star Liberty Callahan on New Years Eve 1953, Archer is drawn into a case when Libertys friend, Ellie Lamb runs into them at dinner.  Ellie is afraid someone is trying to kill her and Archer agrees to meet her the next morning to get a check and the details.  That doesnt happen.  of course. Now, Elsie is missing.  Baldacci weaves every convention into Archer and his investigations  Stumbling across bodies, constantly an inch away from being killed, dogged, logical witness interviews, checking out various scenes until the penny drops, making stupid mistakes, having a total heart of gold and more.  The various characters include bigwigs in Hollywood, aspiring bigwigs, people with a lot of money, people with more money, a very scary mobster running a scandalous, dangerous business, a cameo appearance by Sen. Joseph McCarthy and more. I get a kick out of the characters who add detail to a story, the loyal receptionist Audrey, giving up nothing the loyal greeter at a den of inequity whose response to every question is to repeatedly direct Archer to the bar. And while there is a familiarity to the description of LA and Vegas in the early 50s, Baldacci truly brings a freshness to it and I cant figure out quite how he did that.  I wish I could say more, but the plot is great and the details are too much fun to ruin with hints of any kind.  Im a fan of several Baldacci series, but Archer is winning first place for me."},

Nothing about components are flimsy or give any concern they might bendbreak this feels solid and its foam padding creates a nice comfort grip.  Even with solid structure its still lightweight and easy to maneuver a huge need with heavy snow.. you dont was scrapper to add to that weight!  A few bristles came a bit rogue nothing that wont happen over time but, I mention as you may see in photos.

  {"id": 3681, "content": "Hilariously Entertaining  Well Researched Historically | I was so excited about this book, and it definitely did not disappoint! I love Holli Jos writing style and how much thought and research she puts into all of the historical details in her novels.  Both Charity, Miss Radforde, and Edmund, Mr. Glenhaven, are both likeminded. Science and botany loving and very stubborn. Neither wants to marry but wants to forge their own paths and accomplish their dreams.  The actual scientific knowledge in this book was astounding and added so much character and humor  to the plot and storyline.  I cant have you spouting nonsense about scientific classification systems. Not a single eligible man wants to hear your ideas on such things.  He quieted the fluttering in his stomach by reciting the taxonomy of butterflies in his head.  Probably because I eat bananas on the daily and have banana trees in my backyard, the scene in Kew Gardens was one of my favorites.  That is a common fruit in the tropics but rare in England. Even when it can be grown it does not often bear fruit. It is a banana tree. I have never heard of bananas,  I also loved that Charity and Edmund were so open and blunt with each other, even though they were awkward and more closed off around other people. The witty banter between them had me laughing out loud!  And let us dispense with idle chatter. Save your breath to cool your soup, I have no intention of marrying.  She would make him an excellent wife. What an inconvenient thought!  I loved the first book in this series The Imagined Attachment and loved this one just as much. Both can be read as a standalone.  If youre looking for a hilarious, entertaining, and educational historical romance, definitely check this book out! I highly enjoyed every minute of reading it!  Thanks to the author for giving me an advanced copy. All the opinions are my own."},

  {"id": 3683, "content": "Sip your cafe au lait and people watch at your own French Cafe | Putumayos French Cafe is a charmant blend of old and new from such luminaries as Brigitte Bardot, Jane Birkin, Barbara and Serge Gainsbourg, mixed with modern panache from the Paris Combo, Sanseverino, Polo, and Coralie Clement whose breathy delivery is a cross between Birkin and Astrud Gilberto. Clement recorded her debut album ASINB00006GA30 Salle Des Pas Perdus at the tender age of 19 and captures that breezy bossa nova style immortalized by Astrud Gilberto in the 60s, and her album is worth tracking down if you enjoy the music on French Cafe.  The resulting tracks capture that sort of carefree, bohemian joie de vie that Paris is famous for, some with quirky lyrics, Djangoinfluenced manouche guitar, accordion, and Edith Piafinspired vocals from Paris Combo ASINB0006SSNPA Motifs. The charming En Douce sounds like it could have been a bonus track on ASINB00005O6PA Amelie Original Soundtrack Recording, with a scratchy fiddle and spritely accordion that could have been the soundtrack to ToulouseLautrecs Montmartre. Others are slower and moodier, such as Brigitte Bardots Un Jour Comme Un Autre. If youve always wanted to visit a Paris sidewalk cafe but have been scared off by the skyrocketing Euro, purchase Putumayos French Cafe and enjoy with a bowl of cafe au lait and a croissant if you close your eyes, you wont know youre not in Paris."},

I decided to try the 34E34 as a possible 34sister34 size and the cup is good... there is a silicone strip on the top edge of the cups.  Straps are included if you would like to use them in various configurations. The 34nude34 is very, very light in color.  The cup is very lightly padded  just enough for modesty  does not add to girth. I am hoping it will loosen some with wear  but I will rarely use it.

Molly is a photographer..she has seen a lot of things no one else sees in the same way. But, when she finds out that she is pregnant..that really throws her for a loop..how will she cope? How will she tell Matt? Will he stick around? When Matt leaves town after he is told, Molly is unsure if he will come back..especially since someone has been sending here texts with Matt kissing a woman. With all these doubts, Molly begins to search for the truth,because she notices something in one of the pictures shows that he never left town like he said. I love how the author has a way of describing things. There is one part where the author talks about Matts reaction to something..  he stood there opening and closing his mouth like 5 times I,  Molly finally had to tell him close your mouth, you look like a goldfish lmao!!  There are so many more funny moments in this book. There are also some serious and dramatic twists and turns in the the story that will keep you turning the pages to find the answers.

  {"id": 3704, "content": "Faithful adaptation from stage to home | Im obsessivecompulsive, and one of my most consuming love affairs was with Andrew Lloyd Webbers Phantom of the Opera. I first saw Phantom on my first trip to Toronto in 1992, and proceeded to see it three more times at the Pantages Theatre in the coming years. I would listen to the CDs endlessly, memorized the libretto, and bought any Phantomrelated merchandise I could get my hands on, including the sheet music. At the time, I was a beginning piano student, so I purchased the Easy Piano edition, but soon after purchased the regular piano sheet music.  Nine songs from the musical are featured Think of Me, Angel of Music, The Phantom of the Opera, Music of the Night, Prima Donna, All I Ask of You, Masquerade, Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again, and The Point of No Return. There are also an extensive series of stage photographs some color, some black and white sprinkled throughout, as well as brief bios on Lloyd Webber composer, Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe lyrics.  Many have argued the merit or lack of Lloyd Webbers composing abilities, so Ill not get into that here. The nine arrangements are piano solos unlike some transcriptions, where the piano is relegated to the role of accompanist of intermediate difficulty that are faithful to the stage and recorded versions, with sweeping hints of strings captured in the fluid, expressive lefthand ornaments and a foreboding sense of dread in the pounding octave baseline introduced in Angel of Music that provides a nice segue into Phantom of the Opera. Generally, the fingering is not difficult, although theres a sticky chord progression at the beginning of Phantom of the Opera that took me some practice to hammer out.  Showstopper Music of the Night is given a gentle, lullabylike quality with a lowkey arrangement for left hand, letting the melody shine. The enchanting, musicboxlike Prima Donna is transformed into a slow waltz that echoes the haunting minor chord progression from Phantom of the Opera. The other standout is Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again, a fragile, belllike minor melody that blooms into an impassioned chorus and an ending that hauntingly fades away.  The learning curve is generally short, with the exception of some tricky chord progressions on Phantom, Prima Donna, and Point of No Return, and intermediate to advanced piano students should feel right at home. Note that this arrangement is piano and voice there are no guitar tabs provided, only chords. A perfect give for your phavorite Phantom phan."},
  {"id": 3705, "content": "Well made dont generate heat like incandescent bulbs | The days of the old incandescent bulb are numbered.  In fact I heard that they have stopped making them except for special purpose bulbs.  I am sure that some people dont want to buy LED bulbs because they are more expensive.  LED bulbs offer several advantages over conventional bulbs.  First of all they tend to last a lot longer or at least are supposed to I think that might be debatable.  Secondly, they dont generate much heat and use less electricity than incandescent bulbs.  Thirdly and this is an opinion only, I think they tend to put out brighter, whiter light and I like the light quality much better than compact fluorescent bulbs or regular bulbs.  As to this brand, they appear to be well made and attractive.  I checked all 6 bulbs in the pack and they all worked.  The acid test is how long these will last, but since they probably wont burn out for years, I cant comment on that.  Even if they last only about as long as regular bulbs, they are probably still worth the small extra price because of the energy savings.  Also if you have inquisitive children, they wont burn themselves if they touch an LED bulb.  I have burned myself touching a regular bulb and halogen bulbs get very hot.  I have replaced some of my halogen lights with LEDs.  I am only buying LED bulbs from now on.  They make them in most sizes now for most applications.  Not sure if other sizes are available in this brand, but I just replaced two 4foot long fluorescent tubes with LED tubes not this brand and I love them.  Not sure how this brand compares in prices to other brands, but they dont seem very expensive.  I think prices have come down on LED bulbs and as the older type of bulbs go away, prices may get even better.  I think you can buy these with confidence.  If you havent used LED bulbs before, try a pack and you will never go back to other types of bulbs."},

This one has a  barely noticeable citrusy scent. It is thick and absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesnt leave any stickiness behind either. Ive been able to use just a pump or two of serum to cover my face. Since I already use vitamin C serums, I cant really notice any differences in my face, but I have been putting a little on the back of one of my hands and I can easily which hand Ive been applying it to because the skin looks smoother and the appearance of lines have diminished greatly.

I actually thought it would run out of the charge at some point and I would have to use it unelectrified. To my surprise, even after using the brush a minimum of twice a day, the Sonicare 5600 maintained the charge. The carrying case was compact and protective and actually made the portability of the toothbrush an ease. As far as the teeth cleaning goes, I love Sonicare. My teeth always feel dentistfresh twice a day and I know that my checkups have improved greatly over the years by using Sonicare in contrast to other toothbrushes. I highly reccommend this toothbrush to everyone. Holds a charge, cleans teeth flawlessly and will last for years."},
  {"id": 3736, "content": "Great Album, Great Songs, but some damaged songs | Its great to see some Margo Smith albums available now, as her stuff was a little hard to find until recently. She has a great voice and this is a nice album with a lot of variety. This is a good deal because of the number of songs on the album. Unfortunately the album has three damaged songs and until the problem is fixed, you will be getting a messed up album. Two of the songs start in the middle Alone and Wheel of Fortune and a third song Its A Sin To Tell A Lie is a completely different song by a different artist. In fairness to Amazon, this does not appear to be an Amazon problem, as I found the SAME exact issue on several other emusic services and as of this writing MidApril the problem has not been corrected on any of the services. KTel, the distributor, was notified of the problem and was supposed to fix it, but so far nothing has happened. Unfortunately one or two of these songs appear on other Margo Smith albums and the same songs have the same problem. I hope they fix it rather than withdrawing the albums. Margo Smith has a clear, strong voice and all these songs are a real pleasure to listen to. If you are not familiar with this singer, I highly recommend you give a listen and encourage Amazon to get the problem tracks fixed."},
  {"id": 3737, "content": "Some Assembly Required | I ordered this specifically for my elderly father. He lives in an independent living place by himself.  I thought this would be great for his door. I was a little surprised when I opened it. It requires some assembly. I was expecting it to be ready to put on the door. Luckily its in my possession right now, so I am able to get it ready for him. The twine for hanging has to be attached. Plus, the welcome phrase has to be put on as well. There are adhesive dot stickers on the wreath, so all you have to do is remove the paper from the sticker and position the welcome and press down on it to make sure it sticks. It was really easy to do. The welcome is made out of cardboard which I didnt expect. But thats totally on me because when I went back to read the product description again, the company is fully transparent about the materials used. I have included a couple of pictures. One is of the welcome wording. The corners on one of the ends are bent. Another issue, it looks like the printing on the wreath part was cut incorrectly, or printed off center. Ive included a picture of that as well. You can see theres a different image red on the interior edge of the center of the wreath. Those issues would bother me personally. To be honest, I would not put this on my door. However, I think it will work perfectly for my 82 year old father. The holiday pieces attach to the wreath with Velcro. I may have to call him to remind him to make the changes! Its an easy decoration for him to have that encompasses a lot of different holidays."},

Within a week of taking this thymus I began with two capsules and worked up to three the following week, then increase week after and so on, my body began to handle foods differently. I also switched from Benadryl to Cetirizine Hydrochlorate generic Zyrtec by Up and Up brand from Target which is only soyfree one I could find along with Famotidine by Up and Up also soyfree version of Pepcid and simply took this Ancestral Thymus, nothing else except pure food. I have noticed a positive difference in how my body handles outdoor allergens on the days I take this.  I gave my grandfather some to try and after three days he ordered it and a week later told me his knee pain was disappearing I think its due to the increase in his iron. I highly recommend this product. If you have a severe grass allergy start off low and alternate days to see how your body handles it...everyone is different. I was able to handle it daily for several days then two days off....then back on since Im also taking their Spleen for increasing my iron levels and ferritin iron storage between iron infusions due to chronic anemia back in fall of last year.

I still have all of the original Legos, boxes and instructions Legos are a timeless creative toy for children of all ages. When the first Harry Potter book came out a few years ago, I was hooked from the first sentence! Ive read all four books a number of times and Im eagerly awaiting the release of the first Harry Potter movie this November. When I saw that Lego was coming out with Harry Potter kits I was thrilled! There are eleven kits in all right now, each of which represent an important scene from the first Harry Potter novel, but the neatest one hands down is Hogwarts Castle. The castle features secret hidden compartments and treasure chests, a spiral staircase that moves, torches, one of the boats that carry students across the lake to Hogwarts, and many of the books characters in Lego form, including Harry, Hedwig, Ron, Scabbers the rat, Hermione, Dumbledore, Snape, Hagrid, Peeves and Draco Malfoy. The architecture is brilliant arches, grated windows, stone texturing, a balcony, multiple towers and a large interior. Quite honestly this is the coolest Lego set ever created, period. It is sure to be a hot seller on many Christmas lists this year, will probably be the quotFurbyquot of 2001, and with good reason. Harry Potter marked a return to kids actually READING, and likewise with Harry Potter Legos kids will have the chance to use their creativity and imaginations building something magical instead of sitting in front of a TV or computer screen. Thats an amazing feat in itself in an age of high technology and should be appreciated by parents and teachers! The new Harry Potter line of Legos features new artistic heights for Lego designers. Some of the kits come with brightly coloured backdrops and props, such as the Hogwarts Classrooms set, Diagon Alley Shops and Gryffindor House, and include details from the books, such as the portrait of the Fat Lady in Gryffindor House. All the kits capture the childhood magic and the unique flavour and subtle humour of the Harry Potter books. Hogwarts Castle is 682 pieces and is recommended for ages 812. Because of the complexity it might be a bit frustrating for younger children, even for us kidults  But if youre looking for a unique, creative, and absolutely magical gift for that favourite child, this is the one. Whether youre a kid or a kid at heart, Hogwarts Castle has something to offer for everyone."},

The dinosaurs are hungry. If you cant feed them, theyll still eat  guess what?  your other dinosaurs! Very well made and lots of fun. If you dont like this game, maybe board games arent your thing.  I look at this game as an example to understand how to make games well. I think anyone who likes board games has to give at least one Tiny Epic game a try, and this is the one I would recommend most.  Limited closet space? Desperate for something besides Monopoly, Risk, or Settlers of Catan? Like building games with dire consequences? Think dinosaurs are the least bit cool or interesting? Look no further.  My only minor criticism is that some might consider it complex with the different special dinosaurs and some of the rules about how and when to place dinos. Any board game is going to have a learning curve, and this one is small."},

One thing that was disappointing... how stingy they were with the jute rope for hanging them!  I didnt have enough to hand all the snowflakes  short just one  I could see right away that I needed to be very careful with it  so I was VERY careful.. giving each one JUST ENOUGH to tie the knot.  The jute is cheap  so it would be nice if they gave a bit extra.  The wooden box they come in was wrapped with a bit of thinner jute  so I robbed a bit of that to finish the last snowflake.

The lace arms on this dress are not too tight or constraining. The neckline is perfect. I dont have to wear a plunge bra or safety pin anything together. The waist cinches nicely. The dress grazes the floor when I am wearing flats or barefoot. The dress is easy to pull over my head to put on.The fabric is surprisingly soft. The lace is not itchy. I will probably wear a body shaper underneath it because I wasnt thrilled with some of my curves  but that is not a reflection on the dress in anyway. The dress has a good overall construction.

  {"id": 3833, "content": "Excellent, Absorbing, and Psychologically Astute | 34The Year She Left Us34 by Kathryn Ma is the story of a multigenerational Chinese American family told from multiple points of view.  At the center of the story is the youngest member, Ari short for Ariadne, a very young adult who is trying to come to terms with having been abandoned as an infant on the steps of a Chinese department store and adopted by a single parent, Charlie short for Charlotte, a Chinese American public defender with more than a touch of social worker in her.  The other major narrative voices are those of Charlies sister, Les short for Lesley, a lawyerjudge, and their mother and Aris grandmother, Gran.  Each of these women is complex and interesting, each strong in her own ways.  As the book opens, Ari has graduated from high school and is on her way to her grandmothers alma mater, Bryn Mawr.  She decides to visit China with her closest friend, A.J., who is also a Chinese adoptee, to see the orphanage she was adopted from and to determine whether her birth parents ever regretted their decision to give her up and tried to retrieve her.  The reader realizes that this is futile, but it is important to Ari, who is suffering from many of the issues that beset adopted children, especially those of abandonment and the fantasy of 34what might have been.34  In China, Ari suffers what can only be called a breakdown and does something irrevocable to herself, a highly symbolic act that I will not reveal.  Meanwhile, at home in San Francisco, Charlie is living in major denial that anything is wrong with Ari.  She wants her to come home in time to get ready for college she has no clue as to Aris true state of mind.  Charlie has a secret of her own, one that is not revealed until midway through the book, but it has a major impact on all the characters.  Less importance as a character increases as the book proceeds despite being sisters, Les and Charlie  are very different personalities with diametrically opposed approaches to life.  Gran has the strongest personality of all.  She and her sister left China after World War II, leaving their entire family behind to deal with the horrors of the Communist regime.  Gran has more secrets than anyone else, and some are revealed only in the final chapters of the book when she herself returns to China for a visit.  Most reviewers would classify this book as a coming of age story, and indeed it is, but it is also a family saga, a cautionary tale about the corrosive power of the past and its secrets, and the dangers of not dealing with reality.  Frustrating as all of these characters are, they are also endearing the reader cannot help but feel affection and sympathy for each one of them.  The writing is superb if I have any issues, it would be with the pacing of the book about a third of the way through, when it seems just a bit sluggish.  The second half, however, is riveting it was hard to put the book down.  I know personally some young adult adoptees, and the issues Ari is dealing with seem authentic and well defined.  I hope to share this book with my young adoptee friends, as well as with their parents and others who are trying to help them deal with their issues of abandonment and identity. I give this book my highest recommendation."},

As the book opens, she is finally in a stable and loving place, but that does not mean her problems are overfar from it.  The book is written in the form of journal entries.  As Ronnie navigates her new home, school, friends, church, and so on, we see both her issues as a teen and her complicating issues as a foster child.  We learn of her pastabsent dad, utterly irresponsible mom, cold and unfeeling relativesand we travel with her the ups and downs of modern teen culture.  Ronnie has had a hard life, and she is not the easiest person to deal with.  She is not above cruelty herself, especially with respect to her unfortunate friend Cat.  Her past has left its scars, yet Ronnie is an appealing character, and I think the teenage girl audience for whom this book is aimed will love it.  My only issue with the book is the voice of the teens themselves.  It seems not quite right to me.  It seems more like the way the kids on 34The Secret Life of the American Teenager34 talked.  It just misses being authentic.  Perhaps I am too critical, but I just read Chris Bohjalians 34Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands,34 and the voice of that teenage narrator is utterly right.  But maybe this is something only an adult would notice.  In any event, 34Returnable Girl34 would have been a fivestar book but for the issue of voice.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in foster children and the problems they face, often from the very agencies that are trying to help them."},

Director Victor Sarin chose to avoid special effects such as a mermaid tail The McRaes cleverly quip that only the Florida mermaids have those in favour of explaining the origins of seapeople as being human. quotSea Peoplequot never seems to drift beyond the realms of the possible.

I let my hair dry naturally, but start with one of these wraps for a few minutes up to 12 an hour.  These are much nicer terry than some older ones that I have  but it is harder to find the button and no hook and loop.  The hook and loop just gets fuzzy, hooks your hair and eventually doesnt work.

No skips, love every song. Ive never wanted a vinyl so badly. Unfortunately it seems to be only on CD or digital.  As the other reviews point out, this isnt exactly what FJB is best known for, so if you prefer their signature style, this album could be take it or leave it for you. I like their older style as well, and they definitely shine just as much with blues and folk as they do for this more modern pop fusion style. Reminds me a little of how Mumford and Sons did the same thing. They released an album with a slightly different modern style and a lot of their fans didnt care for it as much. Personally I like both styles.  My favorite track is Kerosene. It has some really intriguing chords and key changes, not something Im used to hearing. Its one of those rare tracks that seems to be a perfect fusion between the lyrics, the melody, and the overall feel of the song.  Runners up are Never Change, Those Diamonds, and All That You Need."},

  {"id": 3899, "content": "Sail away on a tide of romance, betrayal and dark secrets | In Will and Ian Fergusons underrated masterpiece How To Be A Canadian, there is a chapter entitled Art and Stuff, in which they discuss Canadian literature, and in doing so identified the following elements present in The Shipping News incest, female character as empowered victim, graphic but ironic use of violent imagery, healing but only at the end. This I have found true in a number of Canadian bestsellers. So how does The Shipping News hold up as a film in view of these dark elements? First, practically none of the actors are from Newfoundland with the exception of the fantastic Gorden Pinsent, frequently seen on Due South, which is evident in the mangled accents. It gains some respectability back by being filmed on location between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. And the soundtrack, with five contributions from Newfoundlands own Great Big Sea, is a rollicking collection of sea chanties smoothed with guitar, tin whistles and strings during the quieter moments. However, none of the Great Big Sea songs were featured on the soundtrack CD minus twenty points!. The story I dont want to give too much away since the story is certainly...original deals with R.G. Quoyle Kevin Spacey and his scatterbrained girlfriend Petal Cate Blanchett. The two have a young daughter, Bunny, and after Petals demise Quoyle and Bunny head to Newfoundland to move into their ancestral home, along with Agnis Hamm, Quoyles aunt. The rest of the story deals somewhat predictably with fitting into the new community, reconciliation with the past, brushes with death and the strength of family in the face of adversity. Quoyle works on the local newspaper writing the shipping news, which he adds his own personal touch to. We meet his coworkers Billy, Tert, Beaufield and Jack, the lovely Wavey Julianne Moore who runs the local daycare and her mentally challenged son Herry, who becomes Bunnys playmate another question who NAMED these people?!, and long lost relatives and dark family secrets. There is a bit of strong language, alcohol use, violence including a murder, disturbing images including rape of a minor, and a brief sex scene, which give the film its R rating. If you enjoy artsy films, beautiful scenery, an unusual yarn, or Celtic and Newfie music, The Shipping News may be for you."},

My vet said since her eye sight is not great she is a very active 14 year old dog her depth perception isnt as good anymore so she needs something to get up and down the bed. He said he sees a lot of dogs with broken legs, and broken teeth because they misjudge the jump off the bedsofa and get injured. I bought these stairs and a nightlight. They are perfect! She uses them all the time and I dont have to worry about her falling. I bought the medium size just to be safe and Im glad I did.

  {"id": 3914, "content": "Definitely not recommended | I was drawn to read this book by the promise that it was similar to Celeste Ngs 34Everything I Never Told You34 and Curtis Sittenfelds 34Prep,34 both of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Unfortunately, this book has almost nothing in common with them except that they are both about high school students.  In fact, in was difficult for me to continue reading beyond the first chapter, in which the reader is introduced to the most thoroughly unappealing, unlikable, repellent, vicious, and obnoxious group of middle school students imaginable.  I have taught middle school, and though this is a very challenging group of kids to teach, they have charm, honesty, and an engaging attitude that is totally missing from these kids.  After we are forced to spend time with these characters in Chapter 1, the next chapter flashes forward to high school, where each character is given a chapter detailing his or her life and the consequences of an event that occurred in middle school.  Uniting all these chapters is a young English teacher whose naivete is breathtaking, even for a 23yearold.  Top all of this off with parents who are mostly absent and a creepy sexual predatorteacher across the hall, and what do you have?  A hot mess, thats what.  I really cannot recommend this book for anyone.  It was  total disappointment, and in my opinion Ng and Sittenfeld are owed an apology for their fine works being mentioned in the same breath with this book."},

  {"id": 3921, "content": "1840s Engrossing Story of Early Woman in Medicine and History of Medicine | The Surgeons Daughter is set in the mid1840s in London, England and Bologna, Italy.  Eleanore Nora Beady was a small child when renowned English surgeon Horace Croft attended her family for a serious illness.  Her parents and siblings died and he took Nora to his home so she could recover.  She never left.  Dr. Croft and his housekeeper Mrs. Phipps, raised Nora.  Being a curmudgeonly nonconformist, when Nora turned out to be very bright and very curious, Dr. Croft raised her up to be a doctor herself.  But no medical school would admit women and when Nora participated in a surgery with Dr. Daniel Gibson, who worked for Dr. Croft, she was exposed and publicly shamed.  A mentor, Dr. Pera of the University of Bologna, surfaces and helps Nora be admitted to the medical school there.  While women are not treated as equals, they may at least become doctors in Italy.  Mrs. Phipps accompanies Nora to Italy, leaving the aging Dr. Croft and Daniel, now definitively Noras love interest and almost fianc, to carry on the practice.  Throughout, this book is engrossing for its description of the practice of medicine in general and surgery in particular in the midnineteenth century.  Nora has come from England with significant knowledge of the use of Ether as anesthesia, cutting edge for the times.  But while in Italy, she has the opportunity to participate in Caesarian sections, which are not countenanced in England.  There went my perception that these were way more routine than they were for hundreds of years!  We spend time all through the book in London, where Dr. Gibson runs the childrens wards of a hospital, in addition to his private practice, often dealing with the tragic illnesses that endangered particularly the poor, but could strike everyone. Nora deals with intense bias and disapproval from her male peers and professors, but her brilliance cannot be denied as she proves herself consistently.  This would not be a realistic novel at all if there were not many heartbreaking deaths, illnesses and surgeries.  We get a wonderful sense of the cultural differences and personas of Italians and this Englishwoman.  The characters are very relatable, including those we root for, those we loathe and those we waffle over.  The story was genuinely a cant put it down or in my case, couldnt stop listening to the audio version and it had a very modern feel as Nora dealt with the challenges of being female in a male profession, the various surges in killer viruses and infighting among medical professionals.  This is an entertaining book and an easy read, while educating us on some issues and advances of the period.  It has lots of intrigue, romance, life lessons, near disasters and real disasters to move the story along but it leaves us with lots to think about the era.  I was surprised to learn that the author is two authors who used Audrey Blake as their nom de plume.  As usual, I cant say much more without spilling the beans on the plot and subplots, so read The Surgeons Daughter, okay?  Also, as to the audio version of this book, the narrator, Susan Lyons, was terrific!  Spot on with her characters and tone and inflection.  Loved listening to her."},

George sticks to safe ground, not really radically reinventing much of the familiar story of Jesus and his disciples, but some episodes raise red flags Mary travels with and sleeps next to men including Jesus, something that no respectable Jewish woman of her time would have done. Also, during her possession, Mary conceives by a pagan goddess after turning her back on God, then wavering between the pull of the pagan goddess and God, yet later she becomes a pillar of the Church? The characters and dialogue are memorable and generally well developed, and George manages to make familiar material the Gospels and the story of Mary Magdalene fresh and raise some interesting questions."},

I ordered these because they are a name brand and was tired of having to replace the nobrand ones so frequently. My 17 year old son is very happy with them. My 14 year old daughter found them to be too large for her ears. They are basic ear buds. As far as my son is concerned, the sound is fine. Hes not particularly picky. My husband used them the other day when he couldnt find his earphones and found the sound quality to be just average. So far, they are holding up well. If youre looking for great quality earbuds, these may not be what youre looking for, but if youre just looking for something cheap that is going to last a little longer than what you get at the discount store, then this is a great option."},

Im surprised the rating is so high because to me, theyre just ok which is why I rated them 3stars but my last set was 150 from BBB. If youre used to luxurious sheets, I dont recommend.

If I had any complaints it would be that I would have liked a higher than 25 SPF for use down here in Florida so I ave to supplement it with additional sunscreen when I leave the house. Outside of that, this is a really nice moisturizer which goes on lightly and is quickly absorbed. Highly recommend."},

I included a couple of pics so you can see for yourself. The readers I am showing on top of one of the bags are what I would consider 34medium34 size... not terribly small or really large...  They are not super thick, but I think for the price, they are reasonable.  As you can see, they have a drawstring closure which is functional.  You can use the bag as I lens wiper too.

What I didnt realize then is that he could sing really very well.  I was never a fan at least not then and then a few years ago heard Garden Party and Travelin Man and I was hooked.  Thats what got me to buy the album and then what a treat to discover that all the songs on this album are very good.  Some of the reviews complain that the album isnt very complete, but it has 14 songs which is more than most single albums.  Its a good value and the sound quality is good.  Dont be fooled by the Biography heading, which might make you think this contains a biography it doesnt its all Ricky singing.  No disappointments here."},

The book starts with some general hairdoll care tips, then it has illustrated step by step hair styles.

  {"id": 3970, "content": "Very Cute Doll | This is a very cute doll that any little girl and perhaps some boys would adore. Even adults who are into collecting dolls might be interested, although I would not call this a collector doll by any means.  It is a doll that is meant to be played with.  The pretend scissors look pretty safe and do move back and forth and make a clicking sound.  The water squirt bottle might be okay for some kids, but I know some kids would be using it to squirt someone with, instead of the dolls hair, so use your own judgment on that.  At least it only holds a few ounces of water or whatever you put in it.  Some kids I know would probably put soda in it and be squirting it into their mouths!  The doll does have a really full head of hair, so those children who enjoy it, will probably have fun combing the hair and styling it and using one of 3 barrettes.  Educational value for grooming?maybe a little, but this is not an educational toy.  The dress the doll wears is cute, with a pink poodle on it.  I really dont think you can go wrong with this doll as a gift for young children who like dolls, even if they dont care that much about the grooming aspect.  The eyes are painted on and dont look realistic to me, but at least nothing that can be broken or poked out.  The dolls skin is slightly brown and the box has Spanish wording as well as English, so could be appropriate for children of varying skin tones."},

It has not irritated or redden my skin at all. It comes in a frosted glass bottle. To dispense it, you have to pump it several times to get the amount needed on a cotton ball to clean my face. I personally prefer a faster way to dispense products, but if you were to spray it directly on your face, this dispenser would be appropriate. It always surprises me how much dirt comes up after using a toner on my already clean face!! Yuck! It has a natural, lavender smell which is pretty nice.

It is softer than full cotton terry, but thinner.  AND there is only ONE pocket, on the right hand side, so leftys should know.  Why wouldnt they do two pockets?? Obviously to save money, but I probably would not have purchased it if that had been properly noted in the product description. In fact, pockets are not even mentioned in the outline. I 34assumed34 there were two pockets with the model putting her hand in one...

In addition to protecting the iPad from scratches, it also keeps fingerprints from the surface.  In my opinion, the only negative is price.  When I first opened the box, I was astonished  Is this it?  I wondered.

Took one with me when I moved to Florida. I lasted almost 20 years. Florida has high humidity and I set up one in my open kitchen. The last 2 weeks I have done without one, I could not believe the difference. Had to set myAC  to 74 and still was not comfortable. I am pleased with this model, so quiet and modern, it takes double the water out of the air than my old model. Wow, what a difference in my home. I have my AC again on 79 or 80 and I can really breath better and the air is wonderful in my home. I empty a full bucket every 6 hours, that much water is in the air. AC could never do such a great job. I am sold on this, just think no mold, comfort at night. Save money on your AC"},

Ive been a fan of Savage Garden since the beginning, but hadnt had a chance to  see any of their videos.  I was definitely impressed with this DVD. The  interactive menus are cleverly designed and easy to use, and the subtitles  lyrics are great for singing along which I did or for learning the  words of the individual songs. There are some added features such as  chapter access to songs and a profile of Savage Garden.  There are five  videos on this collection To The Moon and Back, I Want You, Truly Madly  Deeply, Tears Of Pearls and Break Me Shake Me. The fun of this DVD is in  watching the differing hairstyles, clothes, atmospheres, and creative  visions of the individual videos. Although there are no interviews or  voiceovers, this collection provides a wonderful insight into Savage  Garden.  The music of Savage Garden represents many years of  behindthescenes effort by instrumentalist Daniel Jones and vocalist  Darren Hayes, and these videos perfectly capture the raw energy of the duo.  This DVD is quickly becoming my favourite!"},

I didnt grow up in a household where there were any particularly good cooks and of course none of them used bacon grease for anything, so I had no experience with saving or using it. But Im glad I started.   It makes it super handy to use in cooking, I reach for this now instead of olive oil when making eggs, sauteing and for brushing on veggies for roasting.

I used a permanent ink pen  black worked great because the accents of the luggage handle, zipper, wheels are all black..  Was a bit of a trick to roll the stencil over the corner, so I ended up free handing a bit.  And to be honest, I used a combination of 3 different paisley stencils  but 90 of it using this particular pattern.  I love the look.  The stencil was easy to use. Was a really good size for my use  smaller would have been really hard, using a pen.  Paint might have been easier  but the bag had a very tiny texture to it... I think the pen was the best option.

  {"id": 4056, "content": "Kimberly Johnson is an amazing voice for the women of today | I have followed this author on Facebook for several years. Kimberly Johnson is an amazing voice for the women of today. She calls out both major political parties, which is so important, because both parities play a role in the future of our daughters. Its good to hear Kimberleysstories about her life and the struggles facing most American women today. I can relate to a lot of what she writes, and I love the way she rights. Her words are personal, identifiable, and educational. I have discovered more about womens history in the last two years then ever before, thanks to Johnson via social media. I know for a fact Kimberley Johnson has reached hundreds of thousands of people who might never have known about the Steubenville Rape, Equal Rights Amendment, and the War Against Women. And now with this book, she is sure to reach millions.  Kimberley is a true feminist in every great sense of the word. We need more like her to impress the importance of feminist issues, which should be everyones issues, in my opinion.  I especially enjoyed reading about the amazing teen activist, Madison Kimrey, of whom Im also a big fan. I first heard of Madison through Kimberley Johnson, so it was good to see a chapter about the young phenom as Kimberley likes to call her. Madisons letter to Phyllis Schlafly is astonishingly direct and sophisticated, and its just a sample of her activism.  Most of all, I love how Johnson stresses the importance of voting in America. We are the majority of the population, and women need more representation in government. Perhaps one day we will see Ms. Johnson run for office. Now, that would be something. We need more like her speaking out for women, and and for the rights of all.  An excellent read by an amazing author."},

  {"id": 4073, "content": "A national treasure! | Ella Fitzgeralds interpretations of Great American Songbook gems by Arlen, Gershwin, Porter, Duke Ellington, Rogers and Hart, Mercer, and Kern are timeless. Her impeccable phrasing, sense of humor, and chameleonlike ability to inhabit a song, whether sultry or playful, is teamed with tight orchestrations and flawless remastering on The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks on Verve.  I first became interested in the American Songbook when my cousin gave me a copy of Rod Stewarts ASINB00006JL4J It Had to Be You... The Great American Songbook. My collection quickly expanded to include all of Frank Sinatras early works on Brunswick with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey and his Columbia works 19421953 and 1940s songbook collections by Jo Stafford, Doris Day with Les Brown, and Peggy Lee with Benny Goodman. I first purchased several of Ella Fitzgeralds songbook CDs individually Gershwin, Porter, and the best of Berlin, and was looking to purchase her Duke Ellington songbook, which retails for about 30. As a member of BMG Music Club, the entire Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks was 89, so I opted for the box set even though I already owned five of the CDs.  The 16 CDs are housed in a compact fabriccovered box in individual slipcases for single CDs and small cardboard boxes with the original LP artwork and reproduction LP liner notes. My only gripe is the cramped quarters I switched the CDs to jewel cases for easier access, since its a pain to constantly have to eject all the cardboard slipcases in search of one CD. The liner notes come in a small fabriccovered hardcover book.  Youll find wellknown and oftrecorded hits such as Night and Day, Blue Skies, I Got Rhythm, and I Got It Bad, but there are lesserknown gems that are equally entrancing, such as the dreamy, nostalgic My Heart Stood StillRogers and Hart, or her starryeyed The Way You Look Tonight, with its soft sweep of strings and mellow piano. There are even spirited renditions of Wizard of Oz songs such as Over the Rainbow and Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead. Ellas jazzy, punchy delivery on Ding Dong is a satirical, big band romp.  The Duke Ellington discs three in all were as stellar as Id dared to hope tight backing, Ellas deadon scat singing that lets her jazz it up more than on the canonical standards. Rockin in Rhythm features Armstrongstyle muted trumpet, a pounding Indian bassline, and an extended scat melody. Ellas take on Im Beginning to See The Light is much more playful and sultry than earlier recordings by Jo Stafford and other 40s singers of her ilk.  Ella imbues each song with its own magic, bringing a sparkle to even the most tired of covers. The execution is flawless and the sound is timeless. Each time I listen I discover some new nuance, a turn of phrase here, a cleverly punctuated passage there. If you only buy one box set of standards, this should be in your library."},

They sleep on them, and its just the right size for a full grown male betta its almost twice as big so they have plenty of room to wiggle. Its a bit big for the females, so you have to put it closer to the waters surface to allow them to enjoy it otherwise the filter flow at the surface will sweep them off it, even just a small flow.  I read a really bad review of one of these that mentioned a metal thing on the end of the leaf the end you stick into the suction cup which gathered rust and when she tried to fix it, spewed a bunch of nasty, rusty liquid out into the tank water. Well, either she bought a different product, or the same makers have since resolved that problem and made their product better. The only metal in this product is safely confined within the leafs plastic, another great feature that makes the leaf bendable. If your bettas keep sliding off the leaf, just tilt it upward a bit problem solved! If they get stuck or seem like theyre always struggling to get off of it, tilt it downward to make it easier especially for the bigger ones like king bettas.  The suction cup works really well and so far I have not had a single one fall down. In fact its quite hard to get off to clean the tank what I do is push the middle of the suction cup toward the tank to flatten it out, then get some tweezers and stick them in between the tank and the suction cup to pry it loose."},

Considering I am not the best chef in the world although I am desperately trying to be, lol, I sometimes overccok items. I found nothing to stick to the inside of the pots and after I have washed them each at least half a dozen or more times, the set looks and feels brand new. If I had one complaint, at all, is that I would have liked the largest pot 8 quart to be wider all pots have a tendency to be taller, but not wide. When I cooked lasagna, I would have appreciated the pot to be wider to make it easier to stir and separate the noodles.

Only downside is that it seems to leave a bit more cold condensation when you use it compared to other products.

  {"id": 4112, "content": "A wakeup call on eating and living green for kids and their parents | Lunch Lessons is an indepth expose of how our unhealthy American diet is literally killing us, particularly its impact on our kids who participate in the USDA school lunch program. Nearly 80 of American schools dont meet the USDAs nutritional requirements. This doesnt come as a surprise seeing as schools are expected to provide a full meal for 1.50 per child. Many schools have done away with kitchens entirely, and rely on reheating processed foods. Financiallystrapped districts raise money for extracurricular activities by contracts with soft drink and fast food companies, fueling the current childhood obesity crisis.  Lunch Lessons looks at the impact of revolutionary school lunch programs that aim to reconnect students with their food by raising their own vegetables from seeds, performing investigations, and preparing the fruits of their labor. Other featured schools buy locally grown organic produce for slightly more than commercial brands, and prepare meals that are proportioned appropriately and contain whole grains, fruits and vegetables without additives, extra sugars, or fat. There are also suggestions on how to green your home by buying ecofriendly cleaners,  composting and recycling, and green dining and shopping alternatives. The book is scattered with statistics on American obesity, dietrelated disease, and sidebars, but the placement was disruptive to the text and I frequently lost my place as I skipped around reading the various doomandgloom factoids.  The rest of the book consists of recipes taken from the various schools and programs mentioned earlier in the book, and include selections for breakfast, snacks, and lunch. Full nutritional info is included, as well as a conversion guide to figure out the daily values for various ages the standard nutritional info is based on a 2,000 calorie diet, which is about two times too high for very young children, and not enough for an active teen. Many of the recipes are vegetarian and are lowfat, and are simple enough that older children could prepare these on their own. Some of the more interesting choices included frittata with spinach, mushrooms, and cheese, peanut butter and jelly power muffins, fruit smoothie, orzo salad, pumpkin curry, carrotginger soup, and red lentil burgers, although many sounded adventurous for picky eaters."},
  {"id": 4113, "content": "Works Well! | My daughter  I recently both got Jawbone Up Move fitness trackers. We were using the clips at first, but felt that those were at risk of coming off. I ordered this set of replacement bands to try. I like that there are a variety of colors. Usually I wear a black or gray one, but it is fun to swap out if I want to be coordinated. The Up Move fits nicely in the band. Another feature that I like is that these are a one size fits all. My daughter has a pretty thin wrist, but Im a plus size mom and have a much thicker wrist. Some of the bands that I was looking at came in small or large sizes. With these, we can share the bands. Our trackers have stayed in place and have not fall out. The piece where you slide the end of the band into broke off on one of the ones that my daughter was wearing. In all fairness, she admits that she was messing with it a lot during school. That has not affected the bands performance. The piece that fits into the notch still stays in place securely. The material of these is soft and does not irritate. I wear my band almost 24 hours a day. I only take it off to shower and I have not had any troubles with mine at all. I would not hesitate to order more of these and I am considering getting some different colors."},

I think that there might be an inverter or voltage doubler to boost the 1.5v of the AA cell up to 3 volts or so to get the brightness that is produced, but at the cost of battery life.  Feed em some good Alkaline batteries and scatter them around wherever you expect to need a flashlight or give them to family and friends. Im ordering my 3rd package 15 lights and I think I still have 2. These are cheap enough to scatter far and wide, and powerful enough to actually be extremely useful.

  {"id": 4150, "content": "Tween Horror | The Cavendish Home for Boys and Girls is aimed at the 10 to 14 age group, but my guess is that older teens and even adults may enjoy it as well, though not for the same reasons.  First, the target audience.  This is a horror fantasy, plain and simple.  A childrens home staffed by monsters masquerading as kindly caregivers, a house that changes shape and comes to life,  children trapped with no hope for escapeall of these elements are well integrated in this excellent book.  I will not review the plot, as other reviewers have done so quite well, but I think most tweens will be hooked by the strange Harry Potteresque events that occur within the house, as well as by the efforts of the heroine to save the day.  Now the older readers.  When I began this book, I immediately thought it was a sort of Stepford Wives for kids.  Children, especially strange or odd children, or those who are for any reason outside the norm, are kidnapped, or disappear, only to sometimes turn up weeks or months later, transformed.  They suddenly fit in their odd individuality has been excised.  As I read on, however, I began to think of this book as a cautionary tale against conformity, perfectionism, and intolerance.  For me, the most insightful lines in the book occur when Miss Cavendish, the villain, says to Victoria, the heroine, You and I are just alike.  And the truth is, they are.  As Victoria experiences the house in all its horrors, she realizes her own tendencies toward judgmental condemnation of others and love of doing things just so, attitudes that can lead, in adulthood, to intolerance and bigotry.  In addition, Miss Cavendish cannot enact her villainy without the consent and collusion of nearly all the townspeople.  This idea is given expression in a metaphor, that of puppets each citizen of the town is no more than a marionette.  This part is horrifying to any reader.  This is not a light and sunny book.  Victoria wins, but only just, and her victory is not a lasting one, as the epilogue of the book suggests.  Perhaps we are being set up for a sequel?  In any event, readers young and old will appreciate the powerful descriptive passages and superb writing.  Five stars."},

  {"id": 4204, "content": "When it rains, it pours.... | Monsoon Wedding is a gorgeous, engaging film on a number of different levels. It follows the Verma family as they prepare for their daughter Aditis wedding to an Indian who had been living in Houston and working as a computer engineer a common theme throughout the film is the Indian diaspora to Western countries in order to have a better chance at success, such as cousin Rahul, the family idiot just back from years in Australia note the Australian accent of actor Randeep Hooda is real he obtained both his bachelors and masters degrees in business management in Melbourne.   The film is full of the hectic moments that can only come before stressful family gatherings such as weddings shopping for wedding saris, building outdoor canopies, guest lists, preparations....compounded by the pouring rain of the monsoon season. Monsoon Wedding beautifully captures a vibrant modern India, at home in Hindi, Punjabi and English, turbans and Tshirts, and the showstopping spectacles of Bollywood. Music plays a large role in the film as a background element and also as dance numbers at the wedding, and Torontonian Mychael Danna who also scored Monsoon Wedding director Mira Nairs Kama Sutra strikes a comfortable blend of Indian instruments and modalities with piano, bhangra rock, and several very catchy Bollywood tunes.   The film is aided not only by the beautiful, exotic scenery, but also by the diverse cast of supporting characters the scheming wedding planner Dubey, idiot cousin Rahul, just back from Australia and apparently an allAustralian boy, having shed most of his Indian customs and past, a sensitive younger brother more interested in cooking and dance than in sports or studies Lets find him a nice boy, the cranky father snaps, a cousin abused by a family member who must confront her past, and a myriad of shopkeepers, workers, and ordinary people that bring Delhi to life, much like Bombay in Manil Suris excellent first novel The Death of Vishnu.   There are a number of humorous moments, tender exchanges between the bride and groomtobe, who, as participants in an arranged marriage had never met until days before the wedding, lively dance numbers, and moments in daily life that could take place in any corner of the world, which make the story universal in spite of some cultural differences. The varying English accents can make the film at times difficult to understand Randeep Hoodas Australian accent was surprisingly one of the easiest for me, and older family members especially only converse in Hindi and Punjabi there are English subtitles. A most unusual love story on a number of levels the renewal of love between an aging husband and wife, new love between the newlyweds, a heartfelt declaration of love from a wedding planner to a maid, budding love between those who have just met yet are instantly attracted. Add to that the exotic scenery, catchy Indian pop music and dance, beautiful saris and everyday touches of India, and a quirky cast of characters, and you have the exuberant whirlwind of sensations and emotions that is Monsoon Wedding. Enjoy!"},

  {"id": 4235, "content": "Great new character.  Excellent police procedural.  Book 1 of series. | Laughton Rees her first name is explained late in the book has been estranged from her police commissioner father since her mother was murdered when she was fifteen. The murderer was McVey a man whose alleged crimes involved rape and murder of little girls. Rees was head of the investigation that led to McVeys arrest for these front page crimes.  But he was released and the charges were dismissed against him.  Still, someone leaked his name while he was locked up. He claimed to his dying day, that he was innocent but driven mad by the resulting negative publicity.  Laughton, is now the single mother of a fifteen year old Gracie. At some point in her life, on the advice of a therapist, she spent time looking into the details of the police investigation and conviction of McVey for her mothers murder. This led to an interest in criminology. Laughton wrote the book on forensically processing a crime scene and now her book has shown up at the scene of Kate Millers murder. Laughtons work exclusively involves old, closed out cases, never active ones. She lectures on criminology and has a huge following. But she is very private. She has significant obsessive behaviors centering on the number three. She is very protective of Gracie and very closed with her about her mental health issues and any details relating to her mothers murder.. Laughton, for me, is one of the more interesting new protagonists to show up in a series in awhile, and this is the first book in the Laughton Rees series. YAY! So Kate Miller is dead and Mike Miller is missing. Their home with an impregnable security system was breached. They seem to have sprung up from nowhere a year ago. Tannahill Khan, a young IrishPakistani DCI catches the case.  Reporter Brian Slade is a the son of a former London cop who was forced out during a cleanup of the force to rid it of abusive and corrupt officers. He is a star writer for The Daily a sensation driven rag and he does a mean job staying on the cutting edge of his stories through payoffs, a bit of bullying and a lot of arrogance. He hates Commissioner Rees.  Someone with inside knowledge sends Slade information about the Miller case before he should get it. Both Slade and Khan want Laughton to work with them on the Miller case.  And off we go into a tangled investigation of a brutal, bloody stabbing,  a strangely staged crime scene that is totally clean from a forensics point of view. Who are the Millers who live in a multimillion pound modern behemoth next to a Victorian era graveyard? Where is Mike Miller? Does anyone know about their relationship, enemies, the source of their money? Laughton certainly has learned that her book was found facedown at the scene. Will she been drawn into the helping Slade, given his hostility to her father? Will she help Khanthe police given her expertise and gift for finding what matter in a criminal investigations? She is focused on a serious problem with Gracie and whether to change her school. Also she is stressed about how to afford a new school.  I have not previously read Toynes other best selling work, but I will. First, development of characters matters a lot to me and he deftly draws even the most minor walkon to create a recognizable personality and some great back stories. Khan is an appealing guy, living in a tiny studio type apartment that he intended to quickly replace but never did, eating miso soup and lying to his Irish mother about what he eats and how much hes working. He wears his Pakistani half in his features so deals at times with harassment, but is obviously respected at his job. Even the cleaning lady who discovered the body is someone whose values, likes and dislikes make up a person we recognize and understand. Second, his writing is impeccable. It flows, is descriptive where it should be and moves along briskly other times. The story remains engaging and one never has to go back to figure out what just happened or what someone meant. His dialogue is great as is his ability to create imagesscenes, like that of an old decommissioned police station or the Millers house. Its not that he says a lot. Its just well done. Finally, plot. This is a police procedural and Toyne checks all the boxes, giving us the information we need to solve this but not giving it away.  I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it!"},

Because the others had a little bit of felt rolled up the sides, the silicone didnt tear and the chair slide more easily.  Just sayin.  We took these off and replaced with the others.

  {"id": 4273, "content": "Mooncakes  Milk Bread A warm, floury hug of nostalgia for Chinese bakeries | San Franciscobased Kristina Cho, writer of the blog Eat Cho Food, dedicates her first cookbook, Mooncakes  Milk Bread, to the Chinese bakeries and cafes of her childhood in Cleveland, Ohio. Presented with an ample dose of nostalgia, the book provides foolproof recipes for such staples as egg tarts, scallion pancakes, steamed barbecue pork buns and milk tea.  Mooncakes  Milk Bread is the first English cookbook to exclusively focus on Chinese bakeries, but many of the recipes, from shokupan and melonpan to Swiss roll cakes and mille crepe cakes, will be familiar to readers in Japan.  Growing up in her familys Chinese restaurant, with parents and grandparents hailing from Hong Kong, some of Chos favorite childhood memories involve trips to her local bakery as well as visiting Chinatown shops outside of Cleveland. Chinese bakeries first gained popularity in Hong Kong, with its unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures. Since ovens were typically a rare feature in Chinese homes, buying pastries from a bakery was a special treat.  Many of the recipes, such as the bo lo bao pineapple buns and gai mei bao cocktail buns, hold a special place in Chos heart.  They are two of the most iconic Chinese bakery buns and I couldnt write a book about Chinese bakeries without them, she says. My Goong Goongs Grandpas and Pau Paus Grandmas recipes are incredibly special to me, and Im so glad that a few of their recipes made it into the book. Goong Goongs almond cookies, Pau Paus fa gao steamed prosperity cakes and her white pizza are some of my favorite recipes in the book.  For those new to baking, Cho recommends starting with the books mother of all milk bread recipe. Milk bread, better known as shokupan in Japan, is an enriched dough that uses tangzhong a heated roux of flour and milk to pregelatinize the starch, which results in a more moist, fluffier loaf that stays fresh longer.  Once you feel comfortable with that dough, you unlock so many more fun recipes, Cho says.  Using milk bread as the base recipe, youll find myriad sweet and savory ways to use it, from sambal and parmesan buns to hot dog flower buns and rhubarb tarts. The diagrams showing how to cut and shape each of the specialty buns are particularly enjoyable, and the stepbystep photos were enormously helpful for learning new techniques. The recipes also conveniently include both metric and imperial measurements.  For those looking for traditional Chinese breakfast foods, the book includes staples such as Hong Kong bubble waffles, steamed buns and dumplings. There are also instructions on how to pack your own bakery box or the ultimate steamer basket, and how to whip up flavored milk teas from the comfort of your home.  Mooncakes  Milk Bread is the cookbook equivalent of a warm, floury hug its 80plus recipes transcend generations and geography and make Chinese baking accessible for everyone."},

So I thought this would be a really good solution  however... its really.. meh.  Unless you have really thin, skinny material clothing... it may lessen the number of hangers you have on the actual rod, however, it thickens the middle of the closet.. know what I mean?  So... I have not really seen an improvement in my closet space.  Just sayin.  And that is with either these plastic ones or the metal style.  I just need to reduce the amount of clothing I store. Plain and simple.  I WANTED to like these...   Having said all of that... both worked with the thicker plastic hangers  just fyi.. but again, neither really works as I thought it would. If you have only thin material items... tshirts, thin button downs... maybe... but even then  it just thickens the middle of your hanging clothing... with then takes about the same about of space if you had them hanging on the actual rod.

While it probably makes sense to have a set of jumper cables just in case this doesnt work, this is the selfcontained solution to jump your battery.  It comes with a nice carry case to keep everything organized too. The display on the unit shows that battery level, which is super useful when determining when you should charge. My big question is how long the unit will hold charge without being usedcharged. Since the units last full charge a month ago,the battery is still at 100 its been kept at room temp Im not sure how a cold climate would affect this.  Its also really nice that you can use this to charge other electronics phone, etc. in the case of a pinch though to be honest, just get a car adapter.I would recommend keeping this solely for jumping the battery if needed.  The jumper cables feel plasticky and the battery unit itself has a nice heft, but also has a little plastic feeling. That said, it works perfectly, so I wont deduct any stars for it.  Ive been really impressed with this and would definitely recommend it in addition to a set of actual jumper cables just in case!"},

The sound quality of this album is outstanding too very crisp and clear.  While nothing else on this album is quite as memorable as Third Rate Romance, there isnt a poor song on the album.  Some may think of the Aces as one hit wonders, but anyone who thinks that hasnt listened to all their great music.  Ill listen to this album often.

I didnt want to mess with taking it to work with me, so I started out taking it before breakfast and again before dinner. The capsules are easy to swallow and leave no bad aftertaste. Im usually hesitant to take pills on an empty stomach because I often feel nauseated, but I did not have any problems. I noticed a big difference in my appetite. My late morning snack cravings were practically nonexistent while taking it. I still had my late afternoon snack cravings, but I wasnt taking the midday capsule. I cant claim to have lost any weight yet, but Ive only been taking the pills for a short while. But since my appetite is definitely not out of control, Im sure that the next time I am on the scale I will have seen some loss. I will continue to take these supplements and will update my review later if necessary.  I purchased these at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out  reviewing.

  {"id": 4338, "content": "A nearperfect compilation with most of the Motown greats | Motown 40 collects some of Motowns greatest hits in honor of the labels 40th anniversary. The brainchild of Berry Gordy, Motown was originally christened Tamla Records in 1959. The first two tracks, Please Mr. Postman by the Marvelettes and Shop Around by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, were both early 1 hits, and the string of memorable hits continues with Heat Wave in my opinion, the best Motown song ever, My Guy, Sugar Pie Honey Bunch, ABC, Stop! In the Name of Love, Someday Well Be Together, Ma Cherie Amour, Tears of a Clown, Whats Going On, and Dancing In the Street.  Motowns powerhouse songwriting team of HollandDozierHolland left the label in 1967 over royalty disputes and the label relocated from Detroit to Los Angeles in 1972. The hits tapered off, although they still owned several successful groups like the Commodores, Lionel Richie, Rick James, Teena Marie, Boyz II Men and DeBarge. The second disc of Motown 40 reflects this transitional period I found it to be more inconsistent, and these songs havent aged as well as those on the first disc. I loved the inclusion of Diana Rosss gay anthem Im Coming Out supposedly inspired when the songs author encountered a Diana Ross impersonator in a mens restroom, Marvin Gayes Lets Get It On, and Jermaine Jacksons Lets Get Serious. I would have preferred to see DeBarges Rhythm of the Night. I liked the inclusion of Rockwells Someone Is Watching Me with a cameo by Michael Jackson it brought back memories of watching the Disney TV cartoon music video as a kid. The Puff Daddy sorry, P. Diddy remix of the Jackson 5s I Want You Back was utterly forgettable if thats what it takes to sell Motown these days, then let classic Motown rest in peace.  If youre new to the Motown catalog, this is a good starting point, with enough familiar hits from Motowns Hitsville USA heyday to satisfy casual fans. For the serious collector, youre better off bypassing this and snapping up Hipo Selects reissues of the Complete Motown Singles, featuring every A and Bside from 19591970 there are currently 10 box sets."},

  {"id": 4376, "content": "Small size capacity for tools not mom car clutter!! | Love how this mounts to the car it is great!! The Velcro on the back is a total perk that attaches to the back seat.. love the 3 head rest hooks that go over the seat.. no gapping in the middle and this  keeps the integrity of the unit in place. The stitching seems to be strong overall But, the nets on the bottom level look a bit weak and may be an issue if you filled to capacity. The other issue I had a problem with, is the flaps on the pockets and lining up the Velcro closures.. they arent the easiest to close up. However, biggest reason why I didnt give the highest stars.. is mainly for capacity and this is where the product lacks!! Having 68 pockets that span the entire length of the backseat... youd think this would be able to hold a lot but, its NOT the case. The biggest disappointment, I wanted it too so much.. I was looking for a trunk organizer to help a carpool mom... this was just not it! I have kids cleatsballswindbreakerwater bottlesfirst aid kitblanketumbrella... all the regular things needed to be in the mom trunk. The problem is these pockets were not big enough to fit any of the items I listed the actual depth of the top row of pockets is about 1.... and they dont have a lotany forgiveness. The bottom is the net material and so, bigger but cant get measurement!  I hate the soccer ball rolling all over as I drive I was hoping this could fit inside the net nope!! So, if that gives you an idea on size of the largest pocket. Now, if this was listed as a trunk organizer for specifics such as tools? Or, any smaller size items in a car it would be a much better fit. But, the broad idea of trunk organizer... lets face it. Most of us have things bigger then the pocket sizes.. and by pockets think back jean pocket just square shape, not even big enough pocket to fit pair of shoes.. or a ball? Or, picnic blanket... doesnt work for trunk organizer."},

  {"id": 4378, "content": "Too small for my 5 burner stove.  The silicone side strips are a must have. | The concept for the stove top cover can be a good idea. I have a stainless and black 5 burner  GE stove about 15 yrs old.  This cover is too small, which means I had to make the cut outs holes bigger but it still does Not fit good, or lay flat!  I thought from reading this that the stove cover was silicone like the side strips are That I already had, and love those.  Its obvious when my builder build my home that He made the space for my stove too wide, as I didnt want the buildins. The cover is almost like a thicker type of cardboard material that does bend, but does not lay flat like silicone, or clean as easy like the Silicone side strips that come with this set does, that I actually just bought another set about a week before his Order For a rental house  I have.  I cook for my family everyday since Covid 2 yrs ago,  and usually take my 3 large heavy creates off and clean my stove top after dinner.  Since this doesnt fit well on my stove top Its more of a hassle using this, or I have to get use to it and the Benefits of it.

  {"id": 4389, "content": "Fabulous reference for vegans and nonvegans alike! | My first introduction to Nava Atlas was when a friend gave me a copy of ASIN0963024353 Vegetariana A Rich Harvest of Wit, Lore, and Recipes several years ago. While I was browsing at a local bookstore recently, I ran across Vegan Holiday Kitchen and was drawn in by the gorgeous photos and recipes I was particularly intrigued by the Jewish vegan updates of beloved classics like sweet noodle kugel, tzimmes, matzoh balls and challah.  Nava was kind enough to send a review copy, and I promptly singled out four test recipes massaged kale salad, skinny figgy bars, citrusroasted tofu, and the chocolate orange cake. The kale salad was delicious and easily modified Ive been making it with mustard greens and candied ginger since it lends itself to experimentation with other dried fruits, greens, and seeds  nuts. It takes only moments to throw together, and is a perfect lastminute side dish for a potluck or party.  The skinny figgy bars are a guiltfree update on Fig Newtons a paste of figs and dates is perked up by a touch of lemon juice, cinnamon and ginger the filling would make a great jam or spread on its own I soaked the dates in hot water to soften them before adding them to the food processor. The quickoat crust almost seemed too wet upon mixing, but baked up tender and moist. I also made the optional orange drizzle, which gave the bars an additional boost of citrus that complemented the lemon juice in the filling.  For the citrusroasted tofu, I used Italian bitter orange marmalade, which is then mixed with dry mustard, soy sauce, and pepper.  I left out the carrot and almond garnish, as well as the tarragon and curry powder, since I wanted the flavor focus to be on the citrus. One caveat I didnt leave enough space between the slices of tofu while baking, so the edges didnt get as crispy as I would have liked. The final flavor was great, though, and I will definitely make this again using a larger roasting pan and would consider making 1.5 times the marinade, since much of it bakes off in the oven, and youre supposed to use the extra marinade to spoon over before serving.  Finally, the chocolate orange cake seemed to be a very thick batter half whole wheat, half unbleached flour that seemed to be a bit dense when it baked up, but the orange zest and juice made for a very moist, flavorful cake its difficult to believe that its fatfree. Theres even an unexpected touch of balsamic vinegar I used some of my prized 18year balsamic from Fustinis, which has an incredible depth. Rarely have I had a recipe turn out like the included photo, but the chocolateorange cake looked runwayready and was quickly devoured by an appreciative audience.  The ingredients and instructions are clearly laid out in an easytoread font, and there are plenty of gorgeous fullcolor photos throughout. I loved that the recipe titles were colorcoded to correspond with the section they were in Passover titles were in blue, Easter recipes in purple, etc.. I loved that the dishes arranged by season, so you can easily make use of the freshest seasonal produce. All of the recipes I tried turned out as described without requiring any tweaking, and I would definitely make them again. Theres a huge wealth of influences youll find Middle Easterninspired dips and spreads, Mexican and Asian flavors, Eastern European and Jewish comfort food, and Native American influences for Thanksgiving.  Two small things that could have improved the book for me would have been nutritional info and an easiertouse index the index font is about half the size of the recipes, and its difficult to quickly locate a given ingredient or recipe since theyre lumped together in paragraph form, but overall Vegan Holiday Kitchen is a wonderful addition to anyones cookbook library.

Cons  Right shift key is in a nonstandard location and too small  Key action feel is a bit springy  Key action travel is a bit too far which sometimes results in hitting two keys instead of one more typing errors  Trackpad could be larger in area and the buttons moved down to make better use of available space it would have made more sense for the buttons to be lined up with the bottom row of the keyboard instead they are halfway between the 2nd and 3rd rows.

The material that lays against your skin is a softer, material. Its surprisingly comfortable. I put it on one morning and went about my day. I forgot I was even wearing it until I was getting ready for bed. Its easy to adjust for all sizes. Theres plenty of room for your travel essentials such as ID, passport, credit cards, money,  room key with a little extra room if needed. All the zippers are strong and secure and move easily. I will definitely be sharing this one with my Dad for his next trip!  I received this money belt for the purpose of trying it out  reviewing it. My thoughts  opinions are my own."},
  {"id": 4427, "content": "Orphan X Continues to Please as a Series | Dark Horse does not disappoint. As a condition of his presidential pardon read the other books! Evan Smoak, the Nowhere Man, formerly Orphan X must not use his considerable skills anymore. Skills gained in an intensive program under a former administration to pluck foster children from care at age 12 or so and make them government assassins to solve those problems where legal options are not options. Evans trainer Jack became something of a father figure and he valued instilling humanity into Evan, along with ten commandments that are Evans own ethical code. Along the way, Evan took on Joey, an Orphan program washout who Jack also was training. Because the government is trying to wipe out all Orphans, washouts or not, Evan took teenaged Joey Josephine under his wing. She is a genius with computer researchhackingyou name it.  In Dark Horse, Evan promptly breaks his commitment to retire and takes on a job for a man who heads a crime family, which goes against Evans values. However, the mans daughter eighteen year old Anjelina, has been kidnapped by a vicious crime family, known f0r torture, flooding the markets with adulterated illegal drugs that kill, taking no prisoners. Evan agrees to take a deadly chance of course and infiltrate the cartel that holds Anjelina. Of COURSE there are cinematically vivid scene of violence and clever choices made to take out his opponents. For me, it is this COMBINED with the backdrop of Evan trying to figure out life that makes these novels so engaging. In Dark Horse, Evans relationship with prosecutor Mia and her young son Peter deepens. He has a parentchild like battle with Joey about her desire to go on a roadtrip with her large dog, Dog that evolves over the novel as Evan better understands, himself, Joey and what it means to have relationships. He considers whether there are grades of good and evil and demands the best of his client in saving his daughter. There are loads of great characters as usual, villains, sympathetic but not very good people, victims, perpetrators, and people trying to be better, just like Evan. I listened to this one on the audio version. I enjoyed it except for the  choices of voice and tone used for all female characters. Either the tone they used in talking or the voices themselves did not work with this narrator. But as a whole I enjoyed the audio performance so I just hope he works on this weak area."},
  {"id": 4428, "content": "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds is amazing 22 years later... | Miyazaki Hayaos first big film Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds was released in 1984. Based upon Miyazakis manga, it follows the futuristic barren wasteland that Earth has become, ravaged by industrial toxins and radiation. Small pockets of civilization perch on the edge of the Sea of Decay, among them Nausicaas Valley of the Winds, untouched by toxic mold spores. Nausicaa is a young princess with the ability to talk to animals and insects, using charms to keep them from destroying themselves and others. She is a fearless leader of her people, who wants to stop the bloodshed between warring factions and stop the murder of giant insects such as the Ohmu. Although altruistic, she possesses a dangerous, unpredictable rage. There is a prophecy in the land that a ...a person clad in blue standing in a golden field  will find the bond between humanity and the earth, and lead the people to a pure land...  The Valley is threatened when a ship from neighbouring Pejite crashes and releases toxic mold spores, along with a much more dangerous foe one of the Giant God Soldiers responsible for the Seven Days of Fire, in which the world was nearly destroyed by nuclear radiation. Nausicaa finds the princess of Pejite inside, chained and mortally wounded.  The Valley is threatened by the appearance of Princess Kushana of Torumekia, who seizes power in a coup, killing Nausicaas father. She seeks to resurrect the Giant God Soldier, whose nuclear weapons can destroy both enemies and the hordes of destructive insects that ravage the land. Nausicaa escapes, and must save her beloved valley from a stampede of enraged Ohmu...  The story, visuals, music, and sheer creativity are simply amazing. This is one of Miyazakis most original, moving efforts, and Ive seen nearly all his films from Nausicaa to Howls Moving Castle. His frequent lament on the destruction of nature is at its most poignant here, the small seeds of hope blossoming into renewal. Visuals are strongly drawn from medieval costumes and castles in the Valley, the ships look like something from Star Trek, and the insects gave me nightmares and I thought the giant cockroaches in my office were scary !. I hope to get my hands on a copy of the original manga in Japanese to read more fully into the lush backstory of Nausicaa. Poetic, spiritual, and unique, this is my favourite Miyazaki film."},
  {"id": 4429, "content": "No more dryer sheets! | Until a recent conversation with my sister, I really never thought about the chemicals found in dryer sheets. After talking with her, I did some research online  immediately got rid of my remaining dryer sheets. I looked at several different wool dryer balls before selecting these Heart Felt ones. One reason I chose this one is that the set had 4 balls whereas several others start with 3. I do have a family of 4  do lots of laundry each week so I thought 4 would be better than 3. I have been using the dryer balls for about 2 weeks now. I think the loads are drying faster, but my dryer uses an automatic sensor, so Im not exactly sure. I used to think that I loved the scent of dryer sheets, but now that Im not using them at all, I actually like the scent of just clean clothes. Though Ive noticed that my 16 year old sons marching band clothes are still stinky afterwards. Im guessing the perfume of the dryer sheets was masking that before. Now that I am aware of that, I am washing them differently. I have still noticed some static on the clothes when removing them from the dryer. Not every time, but on some occasions. The noise of the balls doesnt bother me, I just shut the laundry room door. I do feel good about using these. I liked the packaging in the little drawstring bag.  Update I just changed my rating from 4 stars to 5. I have been using the dryer balls for over a month now  I am really happy. I did just order another 3 balls  since adding those, I have noticed a faster dry time. The other balls were a different brand, but the only reason that I chose the other brand was because it was the quantity I wanted and they have turned out to be comparable."},

My 14 month old grandson spent hours on the first day playing with this. He loves the music, the interaction and the colorful pieces. He is still at the stage of putting things in his mouth but these coins are totally safe and cannot be swallowed. I love that he is just starting to speak and I can see trying to say the word uno on the second stage of this. This bank is a smart toy and teaches children coordination, colors and sounds.

It requires the use of an app to control it. My husband and my 17 year old daughter have both downloaded and are the primary users. When riding in the house, they were riding on tile, hardwood, and carpet. The Segway moved over all three surfaces easily and without any hesitations. It went over the transitions smoothly. I was surprised at how fast they were able to go inside the house.  Once the weather was nicer, they took it outside. We live in a small neighborhood with minimal traffic. They have enjoyed riding in the street as well as the driveway. The app limits the speed based on how much driving youve done. The more experienced you are, the faster you are permitted to go.  It has headlights and rear colored lights. You control the hover board with your balance and leaning. My husband says if you think too much about it, its difficult to control. Instead of thinking about how to control it, he finds it easier to think about the direction instead and has more success with it. I tried to ride the thing once and had difficulties with my balance. I havent tried since then.It will go for about 25 miles before you have to recharge it.  But my husband and daughter love it!

As I am now entering retirement, and will need to keep a close eye on finances, I know that selfcare may have to take a hit and not go quite as often as I had been. I was anxious to try this and I was not disappointed. I can now do what the salons did in the privacy of my own home and I can own one for the equivalent of 23 times the cost of a salon treatment. I still will go for professional treatments but maybe only once a quarter and I will be using this biweekly in between. It works well and my skin feels almost as good as a professional treatment.

I will make comments based on the previous sets Ive purchased. Just like many others viewers of L.H., I was disappointed that Lionsgate did not plan to release the last 3 seasons on Bluray. However, I want to state this I would rather have this show in its UNEDITED form on DVD than not have it at all. Yes, there are some differences in the Bluray and DVD qualities, especially the bigger screen you have. As for me, I would rather get to watch scenes from this show that I have not seen since the original broadcasts in the 70s and 80s. If Lionsgate had released L.H. ONLY in DVD form, but with all scenes intact, I would have bought every set. Compared to the former Imavision releases on DVD, there is no comparison. When I watch the recent released DVDs, I feel like I am watching a new show, because so many scenes were restored and added back in! Tvshowsondvd.com just released the new about Season 8 a few days ago, and this set will include the movie The Last Farewell and one other movie. Im looking forward to getting it Ive been wellpleased with the other seven DVD seasons, so I dont expect to be disappointed with this one!"},

  {"id": 4508, "content": "WONDERFUL BIDET VERY EASY INSTALLATION ALL PARTS INCLUDED | This fits my Kohler elongated toilet perfectly.  This will not fit a standard toilet, so make sure you have an elongated toilet before you order it. Installation was amazingly simple.  All I had to do was use a screwdriver to remove my old toilet seat.  Then you just install an adapter with two included screws and nuts.  Then the Kohler bidet with toilet seat and cover just snaps into place.  It snaps in very easily.  Also it removes easily with a push button down on the side.  Of course once you have the water line hooked to the bidet you cant really remove it unless you unhook the line.  The water connections are very easy and I was able to get them all tight enough just with my hands.  No wrench needed.  You dont want to overtighten the connections.  The worst problem I had was getting the included feed line attached to the bidet.  You are fighting against a filter that fits into the line and it is far too easy to cross thread it.  The first time I had it on crooked and it popped off.  Fortunately I was able to find this out before I turned the water back on.  Everything is included that you need and I have never had an easier plumbing installation.  Even if you are a complete dummy, I think you can manage this.  One big precaution.  Make sure your shutoff valve works.  Older ones may leak and its nice if you dont have to turn off the water for the whole house.  After you turn off the water either by the shutoff or for the whole house, flush the toilet then just disconnect the feed line to the toilet and replace it with a 3way 34T34 that is included.  The feed line from the wall goes in the other end and the bidet feed hooks to the side of the 34T34 connector.  The bidet operates nicely.  You just press down on the handle and turn it to get the desired pressure.  How far you press down controls the direction of the stream.  It worked well, but took me a bit to figure out that you push down on the handle and that you dont pull it upwards.  Someone unfamiliar with the way it operates could probably easily break it if they yank up on the handle.  It looks durable, but I have my doubts about how much you could pull up on the handle without breaking it.  Human nature is to pull up, so this might be a slight usability flaw in the design.  Probably will be important to let guests know how to use it.  Its much nicer than those bidets where you have to turn a dial.  The seat looks very nice and classy, but is very light and made of plastic, so not sure of long term durability.  Since this contains both seat and cover too, you probably will want to wait until your toilet seat and cover need replacing before you get this.  Other bidets on the market are addons to existing seats, but I much prefer this.  My only disappointment with this is that we wanted to use it with a raised toilet seat, but it will not work with that because the raised seat fits inside the toilet bowl and the bidet portion of this is in the way."},

If you are looking not to ever be seen again and just to be in bed though I totally think these would work because at least if anything they are stretchy enough and very very airy which I do like for movement, but, at the same time... the colour also contributes to it and I think if they were at least a different colour it would help a lot.

  {"id": 4525, "content": "WiFi Setup is Tricky, Control Panel a little difficult to get used to otherwise a great printer | Unpacking and doing the basic printer set up and filling with ink was pretty easy.  The instruction sheet is clear and easy to understand and follow.  This printer is different than any other I have had in that it doesnt use ink cartridges, but instead uses ink tanks.  You fill each tank with the appropriate color of ink from a bottle bottles are included to fill each color tank fully.  You can actually see the ink levels from a semiclear window on each tank you also can view levels from software.  Print quality seems decent with good colors.  I liked the fact that the printer is not overly large or heavy.  It has a reasonable footprint for the capability it has.  Now the negatives.  First of all, since there are tanks with ink in them, if you tip up the printer much when moving it, you could potentially spill ink out.  The tanks have covers, but not sure how secure they are there is an obvious warning on the box not to tilt the printer after the tanks are filled.  If you wanted to ship the printer, you would have to find a way to drain the tanks.  The control panel on the printer is a little confusing until you get used to it.  I kept wanting to press the LCD display, but it is not touch screen.  You use buttons to the right of the screen to navigate.  To make a photo copy is a number of presses on the panel.  Even turning the printer off is a three step process.  Another brand of printer I have is easier to operate.  Another gripe that I have when setting up is that when you are unable to connect from your computer, if you have to end the program, you have to start all over from the beginning with a complete reinstall of software.  The only real negative to this printer is the WiFi setup.  I could not get it to set up properly, until I used a USB cable.  At first I thought the problem was that my router was running at 5GHZ and not broadcasting a 2.5GHZ signal and actually ended up setting up a separate SSID for dedicated 2.5GHZ.  That did not work at all.  Finally by using the original SSID of my router, was able to connect my computer to the printer with WiFi, but ONLY by using a USB connection for the setup USB cable is not included.  After you connect, you can remove the USB cable and then print with WiFi.  This printer only works on 2.5 GHZ and I think it is time that manufacturers start supporting 5 GHZ on their devices.  If you want to use this with WiFi, you better know a lot about your router.  Fortunately you can use the printer on a network Ethernet cable, a USB connection or wireless.  Scanning is a little hard to figure out because you have to download and install a separate utility from the Epson website and it is not quite clear what it is that you download and install fortunately I guessed correctly, as I got scanning to work from my computer however, I could not get scanning to work from the printer panel.  A label on the top of the printer mentions FAX capability, but the outside box does not and apparently a different model does faxing.  As far as how long the ink lasts, I am not optimistic as the black ink has already gone down quite a bit and I have only printed about a half dozen pages.  I think once you get over the oddities of setup, this is a good printer.  A little weak on setup.  Nothing included to set it up you have to download from the Epson website.  Thats probably a good thing as you always have the most uptodate software that way."},

The outside is NOT at all 34soft34 as reported by another reviewer... at least mine is not.  It is textured and hard. It is 34matte34 finished, sort of leather 34like.34  The inside is a plasticlike material, no way to really see if the outside is leather or just a textured plastic itself.  It does fit, all the slots and holes are accurate. I have a sparkleclear outer case purchased at the Sprint store when I got the phone that I use over the whole backside that provides a rubber bumper that covers the edges completely and then the outer plastic cover also provides a 34lip34 that protects the glass if the phone is dropped.

  {"id": 4549, "content": "Merely serviceable, but could have been outstanding | Benoit Sokal, the Belgian graphic artist behind Amerzone and Syberia I and II, returns with Paradise courtesy of his new company White Bird Productions. Originally titled Lost Paradise, the game traces the journey of amnesiac Ann Smith as she seeks to unravel the mystery of her identity through the fictitious African nation of Maurania. There are four distinct worlds to explore, fantastical creatures, and numerous characters that seek to aid or harm Ann on her quest.  I held off on buying Paradise until the official US Patch 1.1 was released available at Ubisoft.com after reading numerous critical reviews of the poor design and programming. However, even with the corrections to cursor sensitivity, ingame cutscenes, and other adjustments, the game is still prone to bugs and the occasional crash.  If the leopard segments were made crucial to the plot, there would be more reason to include them. As is, allowing the player to choose to exit the nonmandatory leopard stages makes them feel throwaway at best. The realtime graphics also look weak and outdated in comparison to the prerendered environments. The ending is shocking and very, very brief for the frustrated hours of fighting through glitches and bugs. Paradise had the potential to rival Syberia, but due to sloppy, rushed design if I had to sum up Paradises gameplay in one word, it would be unfinished, Sokal didnt deliver on the E3 2005 hype, and the deceptive blurb on the box Paradise is poised to be the most exciting adventure release of 2006. Even though gamers gripe about setbacks and delays, I would much rather have waited an extra six months to a year for a finished product free of glitches and more rendered cutscenes en lieu of spotty, jerky puppetlike character animations that lived up to Sokals artistic vision.  The Good   Graphics   Music   Imaginative settings and creatures  The bad  Giving away Anns story from the very beginning doesnt allow the player to discover Anns motivations as she recovers her memories  The leopard segments dont serve to advance the plot poor design and implementation ruin the appeal  Bugs, bugs, and more bugs that result in missed clues, endless hotspot clicking, and illogical options   Sloppy   nonexistent beta testing only two beta testers listed   Character animations instead of rendered cutscenes are missing crucial objects, so many cutscenes are hard to follow or make no sense  Objects do not appear in characters hands"},

  {"id": 4574, "content": "Could have been so much more.... | Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood is based upon the novel of the same name, a tale of female friendships withstanding the ups and downs of a segregated South, WWII, and battles with alcohol and prescription drug addiction. Vivi, Teensy, Necie, and Caro are the Ya Yas, bonded in a midnight bloodswapping First Nationsinspired ceremony complete with headdresses and Ya Ya war chant. They slip into adolescence together, sharing first crushes, a night in jail over indecent exposure, and supporting each other through humiliation and loss.  Siddalee, Vivis adult daughter who happens to be a successful playwright in New York, says more than she intends to in an interview, and the offensive results are published in Time Magazine. When Vivi reads Siddas confessions of her mothers beatings, alcoholism, and dark nature, she is outraged, writing Vivi out of her will and cutting her face out of all of the family photos. The remaining YaYas Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight, Ellen Burstyn come to the rescue by kidnapping Sidda and bringing her back to Louisiana to share with her the secrets of the YaYas.  The movies most grievous flaw is playing up the material as a comedy. In the book, the elements of comedy serve to enlighten an otherwise dark, tragic tale of loss, abandonment, and abuse, but the film shoots itself in the foot by trying to elicit laughs.  The casting is also suspect although James Garner plays a strong, silent husband with a tender heart, the YaYa actresses one from England, one from Ireland never seemed authentically Southern, most times looking lost, and frequently slipping into their native accents. For once, could someone cast Southern women as Southern women, please? Ashley Judd is luminous as the young Vivi, but bears nothing in common resemblancewise with Ellen Burstyn, who plays older Vivi. Sandra Bullock is a restrained Sidda, much more earthbound than the zany, alcoholsodden YaYas the scene with Sidda and the YaYas in the restaurant was just painfulNote to producers it is NOT funny drugging someone with a date rape drug.  The original novel, at over 300 pages, has been cut down to a twohour film, but in doing so, eliminates important subplots Vivis confinement and neardeath illness in a nightmarish Catholic school as punishment from her hatredfilled, obsessively French Catholic mother and changes others Siddas elephant ride becomes a plane ride. Willettas mistreatment at the hands of rich, proCivil War relatives calling her the nword, making her wear a maids uniform forces young Sidda to see for the first time that Willetta has a family and feelings, too, but the scene is cut short in an attempt to play it up as comedy a food fight at the table. The books original explanation behind Shep planting sunflowers for Vivi is never explored, so the films touching symbolism of sunflowers on Siddas warbonnet, the films poster is never explained and doesnt make sense for those that havent read the book.  The soundtrack by T Bone Burnett the man behind O Brother Where Art Thou is worth purchasing, as it combines Cajun, blues, gospel, and standards by a variety of artists, capturing the feel of the postWWII South, but the DVD should be a rental. Extras include a behindthescenes featurette, trailer, and scrapbook. This will appeal to fans of the original book, but may not make much sense to everyone else because of the massive plot trimming."},

  {"id": 4598, "content": "Stops spills, but the design could use some improving | I first saw the Kuhn Rikon Kochblume at Sur La Table, and was intrigued. One of the messiest things to clean up is a pot thats boiled over, so I was interested to see if it would work.  I read other reviews and followed the following tips, and it worked as advertised   First, this is made for pots with a diameter of 5.5  9. Any larger, and the spill stopper will slide into the pot  not catch overflow that extends beyond the diameter of the pot!!   Two words steam burns. Other reviewers advise not checking the pasta for doneness, as there is a LOT of steam built up under the spill stopper, which forms a seal to keep water from boiling out. Also, if you lift the spill stopper to test for doneness, theres the potential to dump starch and boiling water all over the stovetop. I also dont recommend lifting up only one side to check again, steam burns, ouch! Common sense applies dont lean directly over the pot when removing the spill stopper to check  drain pasta.  I tried boiling a LOT of dried pasta in a small pot to see if I could get it to boil over nope. The foam bubbled up through the petals and crept for several inches beyond the pots edges still several inches away from the edge of the silicone but the sturdy silicone prevented the foam from running over or water to escape between the edge of the pot and the spill stopper.  The little flower in the center is held in place by a plastic clip it can be removed for cleaning or to create a splatter shield according to the package directions. My only complaint here is that the petals are very thin, flimsy silicone that would be easy to accidentally rip and these are what keep the starchy foam from overflowing. Some reviewers have had the petals rip off and bond with glass, so I would wash the spill stopper separately. The starchy buildup can also be a pain to remove thank goodness its dishwasher safe!  Verdict  Yes, it works. Definitely invest in the large, which fits 5.59 diameter pots including my Italian pasta pot.  See photo above for a pic of the spill stopper in action I loaded my 2QT pot with a good 5 oz. of dried pasta and 1QT of water to see what would happen!"},
  {"id": 4599, "content": "A heartwarming, bittersweet tale of Jewish tradition, food, and rediscovering whats truly important in life | Miriams Kitchen is Elizabeth Ehrlichs inspirational, poignant memoir of life lessons learned in the kitchen of her Polish motherinlaw Miriam, of Miriams sorrows and hardships translated into endless baking for Elizabeths family. Like all things Jewish, the bitter with the sweet there are recipes and mouthwatering descriptions of desserts cakes, including chocolate sour cream and chocolatechip pineapple cake, honey cake, Mandelbrot, cookies, and danishkes, holiday dishes gefilte fish, kneydlekh, kompot chai, latkes, and scrumptious sides sweetandsour cabbage, kugel, summer squash from Miriam and from the authors grandmothers as well.  Not merely an authentic document of vanishing, laborintensive, but ultimately rewarding PolishJewish immigrant cuisine which it excels at, Miriams Kitchen also traces the lives of the authors grandmothers and the role that Judaism played or failed to play in her upbringing. The main thrust of the novel is the heartfelt search for Jewish roots, beginning by a gradual kosherization of her kitchen one must have at least two sets of dishes, utensils, and sponges, and extending to the mikvah ritual bath and Torah study.  The book is divided into a year, with each chapter covering a month. At the beginning of each chapter is a short diary segment chronicling the authors selfdoubts, past treyf transgressions, and regret that she did not spend more time with Miriam sooner. Each chapter is filled with luscious smells from the past Jewish comfort food as Miriams mothers mother taught her, prepared without modern conveniences, many recipes existing only in the mind of the chef, having never been written down. Throughout Miriams lessons, we are given glimpses of Miriams hardships encountered in surviving the Holocaust, of the pioneering spirit of a young Israel, and the death of her daughter and long wait for grandchildren from Elizabeth, of longing fiercely for someone to love and to pass her knowledge down to.  This beautifully written novel was an inspiration delicious recipes, to be sure, that recalled cooking next to my babcia as she would make babka, pierogi, golabki, and nalesniki in a small, cozy apartment kitchen, and the loss of culture with the death of the older immigrant generation I never did get written copies of my grandmothers recipes that she cooked from her memories of her girlhood in Poland, something which I dearly regret. The most moving part of the book for me was the authors spiritual reawakening and the reconciling of Jewish tradition at odds with the lure of the modern world refusing her children hamburgers and milkshakes, unkosher fried chicken, and pizza with pepperoni in favor of cooking at home, of reclaimed family time on traditional Shabbats, of rediscovering the power and magic of ritual, and ultimately, a greater sense of purpose in her life."},

The guitar weighs under 7 lbs. so its very comfortable to hold and stand up with and the body is just two pieces, nicely matched. The rosewood board is polished smooth. The maple neck hasnt dried and contracted, causing sharp fret ends.  And the finish is great, around half as thick as the finish on a MIM.  The tuners arent locking but theyre firm and steady. The mediumlarge frets are very well finished. The knobs and jack all are solid and work without noise. You get hum cancellation in the 2 and 4 pickup positions.  The pickups are Fat 50s, which sound very full when compared to TexMex and standard Fender pickups, but theyre not very good lead pickups.  The bridge pickup gets kind of muddy so no SRV sounds when plugged straight in.  Its ripe for an upgrade to something sharper and with higher output.  The bridge floats well while staying in tune it comes pinned so there are some adjustments to get it to float. The trem bar screws in so it takes a couple of seconds to get it on and off.  So overall a nice professional quality guitar.  It comes in an excellent Fender SKB flight case with TSAapproved locks, which would cost another 150 or more if purchased separately, and includes a basic Fender strap, cable and polishing cloth."},

  {"id": 4687, "content": "Comfort baking at its finest... | I havent had the pleasure of visiting the Model Bakery I briefly visited California for the first time last year, but I learned about their eponymous cookbook on Rick Rodgers Facebook page Rick is one of the books authors his amazing ASIN0609604538 Kaffeehaus Exquisite Desserts from the Classic Cafeacutes of Vienna, Budapest, and Prague is one of my favorite pastry books out of the dozens I own. I was instantly drawn in by the many classic recipes for breads, yeasted sweets croissants, pain au chocolat, bear claws, cinnamon rolls, cakes, cookies, pies and tarts. These are simple, traditional, dependable recipes no fancy flavorings, rare ingredients, or unusual baking equipment required! that will be sure to delight.  With a straightforward table of contents that conveniently fits on one page, its easy to quickly locate recipes. Each chapter ends with a helpful howto section that addresses certain aspects of food science fermentation, enzymes, wet vs. dry doughs and practical tips and tricks that will be especially helpful to new bakers baking one sheet of cookies at a time for best results, parchment paper instead of silicone mats for crisper cookies. A compact look at ingredients Karen and Sarah recommend Guittard French Vanilla as their chocolate of choice, wholefat dairy instead of reduced fat, and Europeanstyle butter with a high butterfat content and basic equipment will start bakers off on the right foot. For instance, they point out that the thin and shiny cookie sheets that many home bakers have encourage burned cookie bottoms. Instead, they recommend using half and quartersheet pans. As a serious home baker with an arsenal of professional pans, I strongly recommend the ASINB008FK6GQY USA Pan 6Piece Bakeware Set from USA Pans the pans bake evenly and include a nonstick silicone coating that allows your baked goods to slide right off. Ingredients are given in volume and metric.  I have worked with many yeast doughs for pastry over the years, but am fairly new to yeast breads. Even though I have a stand mixer, I prefer to work my doughs by hand, so I appreciate that every bread recipe also includes instructions on how to mix and knead by hand. I recently purchased an ASINB00C18NGT6 Emile Henry Flame Bread Baking Set  Black, and am looking forward to trying out some of the Model Bakerys artisan breads like the country olive pain au levain with rosemary. Their baking method involves heating an inverted ovenproof pot to 500 I think Ill take my chances with the cloche! I also loved the wild yeast grape starter it is unlike any other starter Ive seen in my many baking books. Its a bit harder to track down organic wine grapes in my neck of the woods, but it is worth the effort to do so.  The sections on yeasted sweets, breakfast favorites, cakes and cookies were familiar territory for me I own close to 40 baking books alone, so I am always excited to find new versions of classics. I LOVED the soda bread moist and fruity I added the optional currants and caraway seeds, this was addictive and so easy to make. Their take on bear claws was also a bit different than other versions Ive made this one  has coconut and cake crumbs in the filling in addition to the almond paste. I was also thrilled to see schnecken dough featured.  From the cake section, I tried the lemon pound cake baked in my ASINB0013K97PK Nordic Ware Lemon Loaf pans for a pretty presentation and the pumpkin gingerbread cake baked in ASINB001710JY8 Nordic Ware Platinum Collection Pumpkin Patch Pan. I also had to try making the chocolate rads after hearing so much about them the first batch I made as large as directed and they are HUGE, easily a good six or seven inches across, see photo, then made the rest of the dough in normal sized cookies for easier storage and freezing. Theres a pound of melted chocolate in the dough and 2 cups of chocolate chips for only 12 cookies, so any diehard chocoholics in your life may have finally met their match! I found that even after chilling the dough for longer than recommended, it was still messy to work with as far as slicing I might try placing it in the freezer next time to firm it up a bit more.  The lack of diagrams and stepbystep photos particularly for laminated doughs may make this a little challenging for novice home bakers, but the many tips and hints offer practical insights that I havent seen in my many other baking books. I loved some of the oldfashioned touches like the berries and cream cake you have the option of using white or buttermilk cake, coconut cake, and their unique take on lemon squares instead of making a separate lemon curd, you make a filling that is poured directly into the prebaked crust and baked until set, making it much quicker than other recipes Ive tried. I also discovered some new European favorites like the gateau Basque, a doublecrust almond tart filled with cherries and pastry cream.  Verdict The Model Bakery is a wonderful reference for classic artisan breads, yeasted sweets and cookies, brownies and cakes including a homemade twotiered wedding cake for the truly ambitious that is accessible by bakers of all skill levels. The many stories add a personal feel, and this is comfort baking at its finest.  Review copy courtesy of the Model Bakery  thank you Karen and Sarah!"},

  {"id": 4714, "content": "Could Have Been a Whole Lot Better | Who were they trying to reach with this movie?  There are a lot of movies made these days that appeal to both kids and adults and many succeed in that.  This is NOT one of them, if thats what they were trying to accomplish.  For the most part I dont see this as appealing to kids or adults.  The wild creatures were somewhat interesting at times, but sort of a cross between frightening, freaky and comic.  There are too many problems with this movie.  Bratty kid trying to get attention runs away after biting his mother, jumps in a boat and just happens upon an island with strange creatures.  He isnt the least bit curious about or afraid of these creatures who are 5 times his size and who initially want to eat him?  Give me a break.  When he leaves, again in the boat, he is able to find his way home without any problem.  How?  There is no logic to this movie.  They should leave this kind of movie to the Disney people who probably could have done a much better job with the story.  Too many holes in the story.  Nothing is resolved.  The only thing I found interesting was the music, but the music didnt seem to go with the movie. There were a couple of things in the movie that I thought were totally inappropriate for children one was when one of the creatures knocks down two owls, midflight with rocks.  The creature then says, They like it when I do that.  She picks up the stunned owls and puts one under each arm.  Apparently they are not injured.  In another scene one creature rips the arm off another.  While it is not too gruesome, its a stupid, unnecessary scene.  The music and the movie were both totally weird.  This is a freaky, niche movie that probably wont do very well over time.  Not recommended to anyone.  Hard to believe that some people actually thought this was a good movie.  It could have been much better with some serious tweaking, as it had all the elements that could have made it great.  Its just that they didnt know how to put them together correctly.  I havent read the book, but I am sure it was delightful in comparison to this mess."},

I went to the manufacturer because I wanted to try a smaller set 1 month set which was not offered on Amazon when I purchased it. 1.  A 34one month supply34 is really only a one WEEK supply  the 34effects34 are supposed to last one month.  Misleading to say the least.  Should say its a ONE WEEK supply. 2.  I took pictures that show NO difference to my eye.  NOTE  I used exactly as described on instructions.  ALSO... my front, top 4 teeth are 15 year old porcelain overlays.  Supposedly this system is safe AND effective on dental work as well as natural teeth.  I didnt see it. 3.  It is messy and a two step process... Tube  1 is the a super stain treater and then tube 2 which you apply after using tube 1.  The pic I have included was after tube 2.  NOTE  The tubes themselves were a serious pain... most of the time they were extremely difficult to get open even with 34careful bending34 per instruction.  I think I had ONE tube that actually opened without considerable force, which causes the swab to be displaced making it more difficult to apply the treatment.  They also include a tube that you are to use while you are out and about and have eaten or had something to drink that could be potentially staining.  It has a soft brush like tip. 4. Initially the solution didnt really effect me one way or the other, however by the end of the 7 days my gums were very sensitive.  I have a sonic toothbrush with an all purpose name brand toothpaste and brushed my teeth prior to each treatment, which I chose to do in the mornings. 5.  It is obviously a peroxide formula of some sort.  You can taste it.  With a bit of mint or something mixed in... but there is no hiding the peroxide flavor. 6. In the end, photos dont lie.  I dont see any improvement at all.  Photo number 1 is before... Feb 17... Photo number 2 is Feb 23.  The rest were photos I would like to see if I were considering a purchase.  Hope it helps. In my opinion these are a waste of time AND money. I included the photos so you could make your own decision.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful, but honestly, I will not be buying these again either from the manufacturer or from Amazon."},
  {"id": 4745, "content": "Very small labels limited usefulness | This will probably be of limited use to me, as the labels that came with it are only 1 14 inches long and about 12 inch wide.  You can buy longer labels I guess, but a little pricey at 13 for 65 labels on sale for colored labels or 12 for white labels.  That means labels will cost you 18 to 20 cents each.  Normal price is 20 for 65 labels on the website.  You have to install an application on your cellphone to use the label printer.  I was disappointed that there didnt seem to be a way to install the application on my desktop computer.  Maybe it is because the device communicates via Bluetooth and my computer probably doesnt have Bluetooth support.  The application is a little difficult to figure out, but I was able to get a label prepared and printed. The printer is small and completely wireless, although you need a USB cord included to charge it.  Very compact printer, about the size of a pack of cigarettes.

Because of that, there was some predictability now and then. The actual focus on the books is fairly minute. Its more about the women and their lives. The story is fairly fast paced.

Of course the first is the dirty, the last picture is after a quick rinse and dry. Although it didnt completely repell the rain it came off super ez. And shined up like it never happened with minimal effort. Crazy how good this works. Used this for the first time today. Used as a wax to clean after doing an at home pressure wash with my foam cannon. Unfortunately I have very hard water at my house so its nearly impossible to get it perfectly dry. There is almost always hard water spots. I decided to try this as a finishing product and I could not believe how great it works. Its literally a mirror finish all the way around. Every surface plastic, chrome, rims and paint all shine very easily. I used about a quarter of  a bottle to detail a 2021 silverado z71 from front to back including the inside of the door trim and every surface including the external glass. Pretty impressive. TIPS I used a micro fiber detailing sponge as the wet rub and it worked well. Make sure whatever you use for the wet wipes portion stays damp. If it gets too dry it is A LOT more work. Comes off really easier if you keep the clothsponge damp. Not dripping wet, just hand squeeze dry it and thats about perfect. You will notice a build up in the dry cloth, I used 2 micro fiber clothes on the body and trim and a third for the rims. Even though I used the same wet sponge for the whole truck. The dry cloth needs to be clean to get the best shine. Last tip, if you arent sure whether or not you have done a surface gently wipe a micro fiber on it. If its been armored it will slide without resistance. If not, it will feel much different.  Highly recommend this product!"},

Harry is the champion of underdogs who becomes a hero. He is loyal, humble, and honest although his early life was one of cruelty and indifference. His friends plot, scheme, and feast upon Every Flavour Beans while using their wits and magical powers to narrowly escape danger and disaster. Rowling cleverly depicts the boorish father and mother who dote upon their rather unintelligent and spiteful son Dudley but who basically deny the existence of Harry. A magical read for all ages.

The salsa recipes are very simple and delicious.  The cashew chicken in lettuce cups is much more complex, but definitely worth the time and effort.

Okay story | 19 Yellow Moon Road is a Sisterhood Novel about twin brothers born to great wealth, Noah with a greater need for that lifestyle to go on and Liam who is more interested in the human condition.  Eventually they establish a spiritual retreat, The Haven, with Noah handling the business side and Liam the teachingspiritual side.  The sisters become involved when Maggie, one of the sisters in the sisterhood finds that her friend from journalism school, Gabby, seems to be in trouble.  Gabby is a resident at The Haven and she has left a message for Maggie that spurs the sisterhood to action. The women in the group each have special skills and they fight for justice where it is not readily available to victims.  If I ever read a Fern Michaels book before, I now remember why I have not done so since then.  I found this story entertaining, dont get me wrong, but there is a certain type of formula writing that simply does not appeal to me.  The sisters hoot, whoop giggle and laugh all the time, but nothing they say or do makes me laugh.  Maggie eats too much, ha ha ha. Myra fools around with her pearl necklace and that means something but Im not sure what. Charles cooks food for everyone and its such a surprise a man cooks.  Everyone salutes Lady Justice after each meeting. Blah, blah, blah.  I get that these books are cotton candy and that loads of people love them just because of that.

  {"id": 4850, "content": "Homestyle Japanese cooking demystified | Debra Samuels, a longtime resident of Japan, demystifies Japanese homestyle cooking in My Japanese Table. Included are such favorites as sushi including handrolled sushi and chirashizushi, skewers grilled mixed veggie and tofu, chicken, donburi onedish meat and rice bowls, okonomiyaki cabbage and egg pancakes, and a whole chapter devoted to bento, ornate Japanese lunchboxes prepared according to a strict balance of colors, flavors, and ingredients. I liked the photos of Debras chrysanthemum bento box so much that I ordered an identical one from Japan!  My Japanese Table is a perfect starting point if youre new to Japanese cooking its not as intimidating or complicated as other Japanese cookbooks, and it uses commonplace American supermarket ingredients whenever possible. The vibrant photography and clear font make it especially easy to read and cook with. The thorough intro on Japanese cuisine includes the handy mnemonic device of sa shi su se so the Japanese hiragana letters that correspond to sugar, salt, vinegar, soy sauce, and miso, the staples of the Japanese kitchen. And kudos for a particularly helpful section on Japanese ingredients with clearly labeled photos to match. There is also a handy bibliography and list of shopping resources mostly online.  Like Tuttle Publishings other Asian cookbooks, My Japanese Table is designed to fit todays busy lifestyle and includes many maincourse recipes that take 30 minutes or less to cook using common U.S. supermarket ingredients both the prep times and cooking times are helpfully included at the top of each recipe. Another bonus is that measurements are given both in metric and imperial measurements no need to convert if youre cooking overseas.  I just spent six months working in and cooking my way across Japan, so I was really looking forward to testing these recipes. First up were the colorful matcha mochi cupcakes. Mochi are sticky pounded rice cakes no relation to American rice cakes traditionally served at New Years, but variations of mochi are found in many common Japanese desserts. I made the cupcakes as instructed and sprinkled cinnamon on top, but they still needed a little something extra, so I added the matcha frosting from ASIN1584797215 Baked New Frontiers in Baking. This gave the cupcakes an extra boost of grassy green tea flavor and color with a touch of sweetness see attached photos.  Next up, I tried several of the vegetarian recipes like the Sweet Simmered Mushrooms, Pumpkin Rounds and Japanese Mushroom Mlange with Butter and Soy. In some cases, I found that I had to adjust the cooking time. In the case of the mushroom mlange, youre instructed to bake 2 pounds of mushrooms for 15 minutes the cooking time at the top said 20, but I had to bake them for closer to 30 before the mushrooms released their juices. Also, it was difficult to fit two pounds of mushrooms into a 10 x 13 piece of parchment paper as instructed!  I was happy to see that some traditional Japanese desserts were included, mostly focused on mochi, anko sweet red bean paste, and green tea. Youll find favorites like ichigo daifuku ripe strawberries wrapped in a layer of bean paste and coated in mochi and matcha and black sesame ice creams. The chapter is rounded out with instructions on how to prepare several kinds of traditional teas sencha, matcha, and hojicha.  Debra is a patient teacher Tuttle has dubbed her The Julia Child of Japanese cooking and frequently defers to Japanese colleagues, or includes stories of her life in Japan that makes My Japanese Table part cookbook and part travelogue. The book could have benefited from a little extra proofreading there were several typos in addition to mismatches between stated cooking times, conflicting instructions, etc., but overall My Japanese Table has something to appeal to everyone, from the meatandpotatoes crowd to vegetarians to kids there are several cute bento box suggestions aimed specifically at kids and teens.

Now, the suit was nicely made and very good quality.  A couple of things.  I am normally a 1416, 5834 38DDDD, a plus size hourglass shape in case that helps you to compare.  The top of the suit does not have underwire which I really need.  The nice thing was that clevage was minimized, but because the suit was way too large, there was just no support.  In the right size I MIGHT have kept it, as I think the 34style34 of the suit is nice.  Sure wish they would install an underwire and perhaps a bit more meshing in the tummy area.  I am going to look at other suits this seller might offer.  I did buy a pair of swim shorts in my usual size and they fit perfectly.

There is some bulk, so Ive decided not to wear it under certain clothing items where it is visible because of its thickness. One day, my lower back was hurting a lot.

Roibin, recently crowned king of the dark beings after seizing the throne by force, sends her on an impossible quest find a faerie who can lie.  Kaye is still struggling with her newfound magical nature as a pixie, while her friend Corny, still grieving over the death of his sister, falls hard for Luis, the human they enlist to help them negotiage with the faeries. Kaye is the only one to know Roibins full name, giving her complete power over him. The only problem is that his former lover Silarial, queen of Seelie, also wants to use Roibin as a pawn to control both courts.  Ironside contains much more graphic violence as the war between the faerie factions kicks into deadly high gear. The Seelie and Unseelie courts are locked in fierce battle, with high casualties on both sides, and Kaye may hold the key to preventing the death of those she loves.  An enchanting sequel, Ironside gave a much deeper look at Roibins horrific past and the physical and emotional scars he bears. As with Tithe, there is a great deal of swearing, drinking  drug use, and violence, so sensitive readers beware. I cant wait to see what the future holds for Kaye and Roibin."},

The story is about two sisters who had been separated by the divorce of their parents. I found most of the characters to be quite likeable, though there were times when I thought they were a bit too perfect. There were lots of conflicts, secrets, and misunderstandings, but things were always resolved a little too quickly. I got caught up in the story and had to force myself to put the book down and go to bed one night. I enjoyed the small town descriptions. One of the sisters is a tulip farmer and that was interesting learning about how tulips are grown. I would classify this as Chick Lit with romance. There is sex, but its not too graphic. I am definitely going to read more by this author."},
  {"id": 4904, "content": "A beautiful Tradition | On Tradition, Israeli violinist Itzhak Perlman explores the traditional Jewish melodies of his childhood, along with the help of the Israeli Philharmonic under the direction of Dov Seltzer. Timeless gems of the Yiddish theater such as A Yiddishe Mamme A Jewish Mother, As der Rebbe Elimelech is gevoyrn asoi freylach, Oifn Pripetchik Brennt A Feierl At the Fireplacefeatured on the Schindlers List soundtrack, Rozhinkes Mit Mandelen Raisins and Almonds, and Viahin Soll Ich Geyn? Where Shall I Go? are given lush, cinematic backings worthy of a film score, and Perlman takes his cues from the early recordings and stage performances of the likes of Joseph Rosenblatt, Mordechai Hershman, and Jan Peerce according to Blair Sandersons All Music Guide review.  Although it only clocks in at nine songs, Perlmans instrumental interpretations of these songs are at once respectful of tradition, yet bring fresh nuances such as the playful introduction to the As der Rebbe Elimelech freylach, with its dramatic pauses punctuated by triangle and lightningfast delivery smoothed by klezmer clarinet and slower doublestops its one of the few uptempo songs. The overall theme is definitely a melancholy one as the majority of the songs are slow and in minor keys, particularly of Oifn Pripetchik Brennt A Feierl, which I will forever associate with Schindlers List. Tradition is the nostalgically wistful, subdued cousin of Perlmans boisterous klezmer album In the Fiddlers House, but there is much to appreciate of Perlmans passionate violin solos and Seltzers somber stringdrenched backing that gives these songs a weight and dignity beyond their theatrical origins. Tradition is perhaps best appreciated next to Perlmans incomparable performance on John Williams haunting soundtrack to Schindlers List."},

  {"id": 4940, "content": "Ambivalent feeling toward this one | The premise of Afterwards by Rosamund Lupton is similar to that of The Lovely Bones  a dead  or nearly dead person communicates with others in an attempt to uncover a crime.  In the case of Afterwards, the crime is arson, and the beginning of the book is well donefastpaced, interesting, and  engaging.  The main character rushes into a burning school to save her teenaged daughter.  Both mother and daughter are severely injured in the fire, and their spirits communicate with one another as they  lie in comas in the local hospital.  Then minor characters father, son become involved as Mom tries to discover who set the fire and why.  After this superb beginning, this novel simply bogs down.  It is too long in the middle, and there is far too much psychological analysis for my taste. Of course the reader wants to know underlying complexity of motivation, but too much is too much.  Mother and daughter communicate, and parts of this section are confusing.  It is occasionally difficult to know who is speaking.  Mom finds out things she never knew about her familysurprise, surpriseand the incredible and undying love of a mother for her child is repeatedly reinforced.  In the end, the reader discovers who set the fire, and the answer is very unexpected. There are any number of likely suspects, and the motivations of each are explored, but most readers will not guess the identity of the arsonist.  To sum up, this was a good story, but not great.  I notice that many other reviewers have mentioned Luptons other book, Sister.  I plan to read this book to see if I can get a better handle on her storytelling.  For now, count me in the ambivalent category."},

  {"id": 4957, "content": "Beautiful and poetic first novel | I am stunned that this is Celeste Ngs first novel.  I was instantly drawn into this book, with its beautifully drawn characters and superb writing.  On its surface, the story is a mystery  What led to the death of Lydia Lee, a sixteenyearold honor student with supposedly everything to live for?  In reality, the mystery goes far deeper, into the lives of each member of the family.  By the end of the book, the reader is fully in sympathy with each character.  The novel, which takes place in the late 70s,  begins with Lydias death.  Was it murder?  Was it suicide?  Or was it something else?  The reader spends most of the novel thinking one thing, only to be surprised at the end with the truth.  The author delves into the lives of each family member  James, the father, who never felt really at home in any situation Marilyn, the mother, whose dreams were shelved by the demands of marriage, family, and the times Nathan, the older brother, whose brilliance is overlooked Lydia, the golden child burdened with all the frustrated aspirations of her parents and Hannah, the overlooked afterthought of a child, a silent but keen observer of everyone in her family.  I was torn between imagining the author as Lydia or as Hannah I suspect she is an amalgam of both.  Many chapters in this novel focus on just one character, telling the story from his or her point of view.  The reader is led to an understanding of just how profoundly even the best intentions can go terribly awry.  Once again, we see people living out their own frustrated dreams through their children, who may or may not be on board.  The term 34helicopter parent34 comes to mind, though this idea was not in vogue until the 90s.  In addition, issues of race in America  and womens roles are explored through the parents, James and Marilyn, who came of age in the 60s and early 70s at the height of the sexual and civil rights revolutions.  Even gay identity comes into play, and remember that this novel is set in 1977, not 2014.  I am compelled to praise the writing of this book.  Both psychologically astute and poetic, it draws the reader into the story and evokes sympathy and awe.  We see the devastating grief that overtakes each member of the family as he or she tries to see why Lydia died and what he or she may have done to prevent it.  I also loved the way the author treated memory, that old deceiver, who smoothes out that which we cannot bear to recall.  I do not think this book is marketed as a YA novel, but it is certainly a book that parents and teenagers may profitably read and discuss together.  The issues  are fresh and relevant, and I can imagine that meaningful discussions and insights may result.  Highly recommended for all readers 14 and above."},

I loved the intimate scenes. Liked the dialogue most of the time. Andie was so freaking annoying.

It did come with some sticky pads to use, thank goodness.  The discs dont magnet to ANYTHING. The whole magnet option what really not an option.  Disappointing.  After all that, I did get it attached under my wooden cabinet over my washer.  The control is connected to the power cord, so I did make a separate purchase of some clear cord keepers that worked perfecting to keep the cord out of the way.  The controller has a red light when its off so its easy to see where to hit the power on button.  There are 4 options on the controller  brighter, dimmer, power onoff and a circular icon which when pressed goes through 3 color options... a cool bright white, a softer white and a yellow white.  The light bar itself is really tiny... its about 12 wide but its bright and works for me as a light over the top of my washing machine.  The body is a silver colored metal maybe aluminum?  the cord and plug in is white.  The cord is a USB but included is a regular plug to accommodate if you dont have a USB outlet where ever you are using it.  Hope it works for awhile, but time will tell!

I liked them so much I started researching other options and found these. The ties are real and functional.  They are 34waxed34 shoe strings which I dont really love because they dont stay tied very well.. but you can change them with regular cotton black shoe strings if youd like. There is a side zip.  I find that I can 34set34 the tie function and use the side zipper without untying the shoe strings.  There is a really nice arch support.  The outer shoe is a darker blue suede. The sole is black and somewhat flexible. As the photo shoes, they are stitched with a white thread.  I like the style. It goes up a bit higher on your ankle than a regular shoe. It feels....secure... As for fit... I honestly think they run a tiny bit large as I usually wear a 9 and after reading other reviews, I ordered the 8 12.  I did order the wide too.  While I dont really have wide feet, I think going down 12 a size and ordering the wide worked perfectly for me.  I always update my review if new info would be useful."},

Theres an index which is very useful, too. There is also a Table of Contents so you can easily find the Essential Oil that you are looking for directly. The sections are color coded. If you are looking for information on using Essential Oils to help with breathing, then you go to the section called Easy Breathers. Then within that section, each 2 page layout is about a different Essential Oil and how to use it to help with breathing. Within each section, they are not in alphabetical order, which if they were, it might be more helpful. For each oil, there is safety information, recipes for blends using that oil, basic information on the plant it is derived from, and how to use it for spirit, mind,  body uses.

I could unzip it entirely and use it as a blanket. The length is good. My 62quot husband found it okay for him. The bottom of the bag is nicely padded for extra comfort. The sky blue light blue material is pretty noisy. It makes a lot of crinkling sounds when its touched. It seems to be a different material than the navy blue material. The zipper glides well.

Its been a whirlwind few years for Hayes on his third solo album after Spin 2002 and The Tension And The Spark 2005, Darren parted ways with Sony, started his own label Powdered Sugar, and married his partner Richard Cullen in a civil ceremony in London.  As one review rightly pointed out, if Hayes was still attached to Sony  Columbia, no megaconglomerate record company would have ever financed anything as ambitious and hard to categorize as This Delicate Thing Weve Made. Spanning 25 tracks on 2 CDs, the album is all over the place sonically in a tribute to some of Darrens idols, including Prince, Michael Jackson, and Kate Bush, and the authentic retro vibe is courtesy of a 1983 Fairlight CMI syth. Darrens earlier collaborations with Robert Conley on Spin Crush 1980 Me and Tension and the Spark continue on TDTWM, along with Justin Shave as producer Justin played keyboards on Darrens Big Night In tour.  Even though there is a unifying theme of time travel, Darrens bouncing off the sonic walls, from funk to electro to boy band to uniquely Darren. Unexpected samples barking dogs, airplanes, horses crop up in the middle of songs, and two songs Conversations with God and Neverland strongly remind me of Tori Amosinfluenced Casey Stratton ASINB00016XO56 Standing at the Edge, who shares the same soaring falsetto and sense of lyrical drama.  My main issue is the balance between uptempo flirtations with electronica club hit Step Into the Light, Casey, Listen All You People, Me, Myself, and I and slower ballads, which make up most of the second disc. I feel that TDTWM lacks the overall cohesiveness of Tension and the Spark, and I find myself skipping over a few of the tracks the aforementioned Bombs Up In My Face and the dark, gritty Setting Sun. However, TDTWM grows on me with each successive listen. Its such a nuanced, complex work that multiple listens are required to do Darrens creative vision justice.  This special edition features deluxe packaging suede clamshell box with a doublesized booklet containing exclusive photos.  Kudos to Darren for the creative, passthegoodkarma origami bird marketing that ties in with TDTWMs theme. He encourages fans to print an origami bird, write a wish or note world peace, happiness, someone loves you, etc., fold it, and leave it in a public place for others to find.

He was.  In fact he was better.  This is a masterful, oscarwinning performance.  For those who complained about this not being an actionpacked spy thriller, all I can say is grow up.  Sure its a let down when you go into a movie expecting one thing and getting something else.  On the other hand, this is a better movie than some of the standard Hollywood fare of fastpaced action movies with lots of explosions and car crashes.  Dont we have enough of those kind of movies?  Watch Die Hard if you want that, which I enjoyed too.  This is based on true events and the people in the movie were real people.  Several reviewers doubted the young agent ever existed he did.  He may not have had much of a role in bringing Hanssen down as the movie shows, but the movie did strive to be as accurate as possible, even down to recreating the actual office where Hanssen worked.  I dont give many movies 5 stars, but this one is a winner."},

I especially liked the behind the scenes prospective. This is a cute, fluffy read and what I would classify as chick lit. The characters are well written, though maybe a bit unrealistic in my opinion. The book is very descriptive and does a good job of painting images of the pastry world.

  {"id": 5049, "content": "The Power of Love | OK, another movie about how powerful love is and what it can overcome, and a movie so disjointed, a reasonable viewer cant figure out what is really going on. What to do?  Well, if the movie grabs you in any way, watch it again, and if it grabs you some more, watch it once more.  For me, it was the opening 20 minutes or so, which grabbed me. Such a bizarre couple, but with a special chemistry that made me want to learn as much about them as I could. Plus, the photography, bits of music, etc., were also inviting in those minutes.  So, I was willing to see the film through, even though at times it tried to lose me.  After seeing it the first time, I might have given it 2 12 stars or so. However, I still had a desire to see it again, now that I could revisit scenes with a better understanding and from different viewpoints.  So, the second viewing really did hook me, now that the plot was clearer. Two people, so different and so flawed, yet finding that special bond, with the unconscious figuring out things that somehow eluded the conscious. I personally can relate to that, remembering I had a dream once, where, in the dream I actually recognized that I was in a dream, so that my unconscious was indeed plugged directly into my conscious.  I have always questioned how in a two minute conversation, talk show pseudotherapists can tell a caller to drop a deeply flawed mate. Arent even the deeply flawed, allowed to experience love? Of course they are, and this film really does capture that.  Someone commented in their review that there were no words worthy to remember from the film, however, I will never see the word, nice, in quite the same way again.  Without the performances from Carrey and Winslet and the chemistry they generated, this film likely would not have succeeded in capturing the power of love in quite the way it did. I give it five stars."},

I just assumed that the old slides that belonged to my Dad and to my inlaws, would work, but their cameras must have been 35 mm. We did give it a try with some negatives that were from 1990s and we could see how it worked. It does require batteries. The whole system is pretty simple. An iPhone would probably work really well with this. My husband and I both have Google Pixel 6 cameras and the camera doesnt line up with this as well as other phone cameras. I have a couple of slide scanners and I was thrilled with the idea of being able to convert them digitally to my phone instead of having to use an SD card and uploading that to my computer.

  {"id": 5060, "content": "Et tu, Georgia? | I love the fabbity fab Georgia Nicolson series by Lousie Rennison. Quirky and refreshing, the books are a Bridget Joness Diary for the early teens set and follow the adventures of Georgia on her adventures at her London school, on dates, family vacations, and in this instalment to Paris with Gorgey Henri. But maybe Ive grown out of the series, because for some reason I didnt find Nuddypants as funny or riveting as the previous books. Id waited for at least a year to read this, and was totally thrilled when I got my hands on a copy. But I found myself frequently distracted by many of the nowfamiliar antics, which havent changed much since the last three books. Although there were some funny moments, the plot felt tired, with many of Georgias favourite sayings and situations overused. Georgias trip to Paris was a highlight for me, but overall Im almost glad that this is the last book in the series. The first three were hilarious, offthewall stories of friendship, wacky adventures and crazy family antics, but Nuddypants finds Georgia obsessing between two love interests and a lot less...being Georgia. Pity. Diehard Georgia fans will want to have a go at Nuddypants, but for all of you Georgia newbies out there, do yourselves a favour and start with book one, Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging, to get a real taste of the insanity Georgia calls life. Hint it makes much more sense to read the first three books in order before attempting this one since there are numerous inside references to past events."},

  {"id": 5067, "content": "Good size for solo loading | I was debating between this and the Pescador 12. Im glad I got the 10, as it is light enough for me to load onto a roof rack by myself. The only complaint I have with portability is that the side carry handles arent in the right place. If you hold it by the handle, theres more weight on the back end than the front. Not a major problem, but it makes carrying it by yourself harder than it should be. My only other complaint is that the rod holders are really bad. They are too big, so I am afraid to use them for fear of my rods falling out. For a kayak called Pescador, that is surprising.  As far as tracking and speed go, this thing is great. It seems like a good balance between general purpose recreation and fishing. It is stable enough for me to turn around and access a milk crate in the back without risk of tipping. While there is no dry storage directly in front of the seat, I have been able to carefully access the dry storage in the bow when necessary.  Lastly, I have found zero need for scupper plugs. Fully loaded my kayak carries about 200 lbs, and it is a very dry ride. This thing is great, and I would gladly buy it again."},

I was amazed that this same bandaid held up while I washed dishes and did household chores as well. I removed the bandaid after a few days and I saw how perfectly the wound had healed.

The two are caught up in a whirlwind romance and various supernatural threats in Eclipse, the vampire stalker Victoria is after Bella and has created an army of young vampires who are terrorizing Seattle. Bella floats through her senior year waiting for graduation, when Edward will turn her into a vampire so that they can be together forever.  The first novel ASIN0316015849 Twilight The Twilight Saga, Book 1 and parts of ASIN0316160199 New Moon The Twilight Saga, Book 2 were based around Romeo and Juliet Bellas inspiration in Eclipse is Wuthering Heights, which goes to show the unhealthy relationships she fosters with both Edward and young werewolf Jake.  In the first novel, Bella used Jake to gain access to information about Edward and his vampire family. Jake had a puppydog reaction to Bellas attention in Twilight, but when he transformed into a werewolf, he becomes a sneering, possessive, violent contender for Bellas heart, brutally kissing her and making lewd suggestions. Edward demands that he and Bella be married before he brings her across, and Bella pouts and fights it like a fiveyearold. Instead of being excited about the prospect of a wedding, she votes for a drivethrough wedding in Vegas, although Edwards sister Alice ends up being her wedding planner.  The tribal legends were interesting, but not enough to save the lackluster plot. Bella and Edward arent even directly involved in the final battle talk about anticlimactic, and the plot was fairly evident from the beginning. The Cullens, portrayed as good vampires in earlier books, are witness to an act of brutality, yet make no audible comment about the poor girl involved.  I quickly grew tired of Edward and Bellas predictable reactions about what horrible people they are, etc., Bellas extended tantrums and crying fits, and Jakes desire to bed Bella or at least convince her that hes her perfect mate. I can only hope that things look up for Bella in the final book in the series, ASIN031606792X Breaking Dawn The Twilight Saga, Book 4."},

It does seem to move a bit slow for the first hour or so and has flashbacks that you dont quite understand.  It all becomes clear by the end.  Its not exactly a surprise ending, but perhaps not quite what you would expect either.  The last 12 hour is worth sitting through the first hour or so.  Most of the movies I have seen Will Smith in are much lighter fare.  Even Pursuit of Happyness was somewhat lighter than this movie.  Smith pulls it off extremely well and shows he can do darker, more serious roles with the same expertise at comedic ones.  He has really developed as a serious actor, pulling away from some of his sillier roles.  Rosario Dawson is superb as well.  The casting and the acting is a solid 5 stars.  This is not a movie to watch when you are down and depressed, but is one to renew your faith in the goodness of some people and how much they are willing to give to others. Its a hard movie to recommend because one cant be quite sure how others will react to it.  It has a bittersweet ending you are sad, but at the same time uplifted.  The movie didnt make me cry, but it really should have.  For pure entertainment value, it was slightly lacking, which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5."},

  {"id": 5126, "content": "Another fine example of Canadian humor...that youll never see in the US | I first read about Bon Cop, Bad Cop while riding the train to Montreal. There was a bilingual featurette on the film in VIA Rails magazine, and I was instantly intrigued. Id seen Colm Feore at Stratford four years ago, and I was familiar with Patrick Huard from the ASINB0006HM1TA Les Boys 1, 2 and 3 Box Set hockey film franchise. I studied at Laval University in Quebec City for two months, and specialized in Quebec Studies history, literature, and cinema as an undergraduate, so I was intrigued to see how the film would balance both the bilingual and bicultural aspects of living in Canada. The issue of Quebec is a contentious one for a number of political, social, and cultural reasons. Bon Cop, Bad Cop attempts to use humor in an attempt to defuse volatile issues between the Two Solitudes English and Frenchspeaking Canada.  A series of brutal murders in the Canadian hockey community pairs together two very different cops Torontonian Martin Ward, Colm Feore a bythebook, primandproper intellectual, and roughandtumble David Bouchard, a shoot first, ask later detective from Montreal. Naturally, the two despise each other at first sight, and the rapidfire bilingual oneliners between Martin and David are fast and furious from the getgo. Some critics panned the film for a seemingly forced, unnatural balance of bilingual script, but as someone whos trilingual, I frequently switch languages when speaking to other bilingual friends nothing unnatural there.  Much of the comedic humor comes from the culture clash between Martin and David, Ontario and Quebec there are numerous injokes regarding Canadian law, stereotypes of Quebeckers diehard smokers, dangerous drivers, womanizers and Torontonians cold, boring, workaholics and nods to popular Canadian culture Rick Mercer of ASINB000W00XXW This Hour Has 22 MinutesSeason 1 does a great Don Cherry impression, Uniprix commercial spoof, cameo by Nanette Workman. There are some hilarious scenes involving tortured translation between the Quebec police chief and his Ontarian counterpart as the two fully bilingual detectives watch in disbelief. The secondary characters really shine, from a speedtalking coroner Quebecois comedian LouisJos Houde to Martins glamorous, hip sister whos hot for David, as does the bilingual script. The special effects are very well done considering that the film had an 8 million budget.  In the vein of earlier Canadian comedies like ASINB00006FDCT Strange Brew and ASINB00006IUG0 Men With Brooms a curling comedy from Paul Gross aka Constable Benton Frasier of ASINB000A0GY0K Due South Season One 4DVD Digipack, Bon Cop, Bad Cop is a sendup of that great Canadian pastime, hockey. Of course, beer, curling, beavers, and the fleur de lis make prerequisite appearances, as does marijuana there is a priceless scene involving a selfdestructing marijuana greenhouse that brought to mind the British comedy ASINB00003CXMY Saving Grace. Romantic interest? Check. Youll never think of Vive le Quebec libre! quite the same way again... Action? Car chases? Explosions? Check. The weakest part of the film is the villain, who is never really developed we never know, or care, why he turned psychotic. There is also a gratuitous amount of violence and swearing nearly all in French that seemed overthetop, but its obvious from the start that this is a film that has no intentions of taking itself seriously.  Looking at these elements separately, Bon Cop, Bad Cop would appear to be another shallow attempt at creating a uniquely Canadian comedy. But there is an unexpected depth and tenderness in the character development between Martin, David and their respective families both men are divorced single parents, and the bilingual dialogue really shines. Huard and Feore give standout performances, and I felt right at home in that strange limbo between Quebec and Ontario from my experiences in both English and Frenchspeaking Canada. This is a gem that deserves to be seen!"},

Shulman is quick to give credit where credit is due, and borrows widely from other culinary experts such as Carol Field ASINB0002OKA8Q The Italian Baker in areas of local expertise.  With a glut of Mediterranean vegetarian cookbooks on the shelves such as ASIN0312200765 The Greek Vegetarian More Than 100 Recipes Inspired by the Traditional Dishes and Flavors of Greece Diane Kochilas, ASIN0764544136 Olive Trees and Honey A Treasury of Vegetarian Recipes from Jewish Communities Around the World Gil Marks, and The ASIN1557883599 The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen and ASIN1557884943 Vegan Italiano Meatfree, Eggfree, Dairyfree Dishes from SunDrenched Italy by Donna Klein, why should you choose the pricey Mediterranean Harvest?  One word love. Shulmans love of local culture, hidden culinary gems, geography, and regional tastes, her lovely travelogues disguised as recipe introductions, and diary entries from memorable stops along her Mediterranean odyssey, both personal vacations and working in Mediterranean kitchens while researching other cookbooks such as ASINB000IOESX8 Provencal Light and ASIN0688174671 Mediterranean Light Delicious Recipes from the Worlds Healthiest CuisineShulman is author of over 25 books. Also, she touches on some lesscommonlydiscussed cuisines such as Bosnia, Croatia, and Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, and North Africa Morocco, Tunisia. There is also a handy index arranged by region.  Shulmans rundown of kitchen equipment and the Mediterranean Pantry spices, olives and olive oil, cheeses, yogurt, wine, herbs, spice blends, nuts and seeds is a miracle of compactness, yet provides ample information for the home cook without overwhelming. After a brief section on aperitifs, the allimportant topic of breads, pizza, and panini is covered first, since bread serves as the base for many common Mediterranean delicacies such as fattoush Lebanese bread salad, panzanella Italian tomato and bread salad, and Castilian garlic soup. Most households couldnt afford to waste stale bread Tuscan bread was traditionally made without salt, so it was given new life as a base for soups, strata, and vegetable salads the juices would soften the bread.  The list of sauces and dressings includes such favorites as Salsa Romesco from Spain almonds, bread, spices, and tomatoes, aioli garlic mayonnaise several variations of Italian pesto basil, olive oil, cheese, and nuts, and yogurtbased sauces common in Greece and the Middle East tzatziki, skordalia, tahini dressing, chermoula, harissa, and preserved lemons. Tapas  meze finger food are given a respectable spread befitting their social importance in the Mediterranean, including Tunisian carrot salad, tabbouleh, several variations of marinated cold veggies, hummus, bean and legume salads, and greens.  The eggs and cheese section captured my heart from its introduction Shulman recalls a Velazquez painting from 1618 of an old woman cooking eggs, with the simple garnish of onion and olive oil, melon, and wine. Such staples as frittata, Spanish tortilla, omelets, strata, and several varieties of scrambled eggs delight, along with a recipe for homemade ricotta cheese.  The small catalogue of pasta if this is the small catalogue, Id love to see the large one! is a chefs dream, and there are numerous sidebars to aid you in properly cooking pasta, making homemade pasta dough, and shaping homemade ravioli and garganelli.  The rest of the book is dedicated to savory pies, gratins, vegetables and beans stews, sauteed panfried veggies, potatoes, rice, couscous, and grains risotto, polenta, pilaf and topped off on a sweet note with sweets and desserts biscotti, clafouti, granitas, fruit compotes, ricotta cheesecake, baklava, and dessert couscous. A brief page of online resources for Mediterranean ingredients is included, as well as a select bibliography. Thankfully, sidebars are also included in the index as they are numerous and enlightening.  Overall, this may be the most complete look at Mediterranean cuisine that Ive had the pleasure to read, vegetarian or not. Shulmans obvious respect and love for the region and its varied, healthful cuisine shines through every page, and her downtoearth instructions and informative sidebars add to the experience. The visual design is simple and uncluttered no photos or line drawings, with the focus appropriately on the magical recipes that transport you around the globe. The recipes are generally straightforward and simple, take advantage of fresh produce although some shortcuts such as canned tomatoes and canned beans are used, and are delicious. If youre looking for one cookbook that combines the charms of Italian, French, Spanish, Greek, and Middle Eastern cuisine along with delightful commentaries on local culture and dining, Mediterranean Harvest is the book for you."},

  {"id": 5149, "content": "70 year old novel with contemporary relevance.  Race in the USA | As a former English major and avid reader of many authors of her period, I am shocked I never heard the name Ann Petry before I read The Narrows. What a gifted writer. Before I go further, I want to mention the forward, intended to introduce Petry to readers like me and comment on this novel. IT HAS SPOILERS. I became attached to all the characters as I read the novel and became immersed in the setting and so I  was annoyed the whole time that the forward gave things away. I actually put the book down for periods of time out of frustration. Dont do that forward writers. Let us discover a good novel without telling us whats coming. So, to all of you who have not yet read the book, SKIP THE FORWARD.  The Narrows is a book about so many things. Written in 1953, seventy years ago, it is contemporary in its take on race and how, in a typical small city, not far from New York, Rich white people and workingmiddle classpoor Black people stereotype one another. Lincoln Link Williams is the adopted son of Abbie Crunch, a widow who lives on the first floor of her boarding house and lets the second floor out. It is about The Narrows, the Black neighborhood in a very white fictional Connecticut city called Monmouth.  Its not far from New York City. Abbies house is on Dumble Street, widely viewed as the most high crime low living street in The Narrows. She is a church lady with strong ideas of what is proper and a deep dislike of Bill Hod, owner of The Last Chance Bar right across the street. Naturally, when Link and Abbie have a falling out at a time when she is grieving her husbands death, he turns to Bill and his chef, Weak Knees. You, like me, will want very much to eat at the Last Chance as Weak Knees talent comes up over and over. Other characters include a photographer, Jubine, whose work is so exceptional he sells to national magazines and newspapers. He captures the essence of a moment and the character of his subjects, sometimes to their detriment, often in a beautiful, deep, inexplicable manner. Then, theres Cat Jimmie, a terrifying guy at least in concept, who has had both legs amputated. He rolls on a cart, chasing women in hopes of taking a glimpse up their dresses. Theres Cesar, the Writing Man, who draws intricate verse on sidewalks of The Narrows, beautiful, but sometimes frightening in what the words foretell. Finally, theres Abbies best friend and fellow church lady, the neighborhood undertaker, Frances Jackson.  Arriving into this scent is  a new family to the neighborhood, who have rented Abbies second floor on Dumble Street. Mr. Powther is the butler for the Treadways, a hugely wealthy white family across town. The Treadways made their fortune manufacturing munitions and the plant is located in Monmouth.  Powther is  married to the sensual Mamie. Mamie has an amazing singing voice, is kind to Powther as she cheats on him regularly, and has given birth to a bunch of boys, the youngest still in diapers. They are loosely raising themselves, though Mamie does laundry and Powther tells them strange and wonderful bedtime stories. One of my favorite characters is J.C., Mamie and Powthers youngest boy, very smart though thats not obvious at first, often unkempt, who worms his way into the very disapproving Abbies heart. Another interesting and important character, eventually as a kind of narratorGreek chorus is the white editor of the newspaper Peter Bullock who knows the right thing  to do, but can vary in his resolve.  Camilo Treadway,  the gorgeous daughter of the Treadways  spends her time in both New York City and Monmouth these days. Link, now a handsome man, college graduate, working at the Last Chance, meets Camilo and they become close friends.  Their connection becomes the story.  Despite 1950s Northeastern United States views of race, the palpable suspicion from everyone in The Narrows where they sometimes hang out and all the complexities you can imagine arising from such a friendship, they carelessly ignore reality and  fly toward the flame.  The story itself is fairly common. It is the characters, the settings and Petrys observations about them through a variety of lenses that makes this novel unforgettable. It is, as noted, remarkably observant about attitudes that are still prevalent in the United States.  It was hard sometimes to read The Narrows, because if you are a decent person, racism is unbearable to read about.  Still, the book it is richly written, engrossing all the time and I highly, highly recommend it."},

Diannes fisherman husband Tim McIntosh walked out on her shortly after finding out that their unborn baby would be born with genetic abnormalities, and Dianne, with her mothers help, has been raising Julia for the last eleven years. Dianne is a carpenter who builds elaborate wooden playhouses, allowing her to work from home and keep an eye on Julias many needs feeding, diaper changing, digestive upsets, etc..  Tims pediatrician brother Alan is Julias primary physician, rushing over at each and every frequent medical crisis. He also happens to have dated Dianne before his brother Tim rushed to marry her, and Dianne carries a lot of baggage concerning her hatred of Tim for abandoning her and Julia. Even though Alan has been in love with Dianne for the past twelve years, her own deep emotional scars from Tims abandonment and physical exhaustion from being the sole caretaker for Julia keep her from recognizing and reciprocating Alans love.  Diannes mother Lucinda is a legendary local librarian who is deeply troubled by Diannes refusal of Alan, and when Amy, a young girl from an abusive home, becomes a mothers helper for Dianne, Lucinda finds many parallels between her own turbulent youth in an orphanage, and Amys home life Amys barelyfunctioning depressed mother and her mothers physically abusive livein boyfriend Buddy. Lucindas favorite novel is Anne of Green Gables, and the novel plays a central role in Follow the Stars Home as an inspiration for both Lucinda and Amy orphaned girl with a vivid imagination discovers the power of writing.  Much of the story revolves around the healing process as Dianne struggles to come to grips with Alans deep love for both her and Julia he was present at Julias birth, being a second mother to Amy when Amy is taken out of her home by Child Protective Services Dianne fantasizes about Amy as the child she would have had if Julia had been born without birth defects, the reality of Julias rapid physical and neurological decline, and a final confrontation with Tim. The final poignant chapter is written in the first person by a previously unheardfrom central character, and provided a fresh look at the many stories contained in the book.  The most startling storyline is revealed in tense fragments, with tantalizingly brief shards of the present traumatic event opening the story before whirring back into Diannes past. Rices storytelling is deliciously paced, full of small nuances and everyday detail that really lend her characters much more depth than was allotted to them in the faithful Hallmark Hall of Fame adaptation ASIN0553581023 Follow the Stars Home. This was my first novel by Luanne Rice, and based on my enjoyment of it, I look forward to reading more of her work."},

I looked at several products before purchasing HOTORs car trashcan. I have been using this trashcan for a few days, and this is what I think of the product so far...  The trashcan was easy to assemble, and the instructions were simple. The bags included are a perfect fit, and I think most small trash bags could fit in this. Its got a very nice clip on button to hold the bags in place, and it hangs well over my passenger seat. It is easy to clean and replace the trashcan, and it has a special braces to keep the can wide for easy placement of trash.  Overall, I would say that this is an excellent car accessory should anyone be considering a garbage bag  trash can in your car for maximum cleanliness and to minimize littering."},

There are a lot of different brands, but I have had good luck with the AOR brand in the past, so I decided to stick with them. I like how these come in a perforated strip so you can tear off what you need and the others stay in their plastic bubbles. These are so tiny that if they werent separated, they could easily get lost. I havent had to use these yet, but if they perform as well as they should, I will up date my review."},

  {"id": 5185, "content": "Surprisingly Enjoyable | This is my first Shannyn Schroeder book and I really liked it. In fact, I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did. I dont usually like bad guy hero books, but this kept me interested from the getgo. Norah, the romantic lead in this book is a young, single woman who happens to be very pregnant. She comes back to her family home in Chicago so she can have the support of her family. She struggles with the choice of keeping the baby or giving it up for adoption. I thought her character was likeable and well written. Yes, she had made a mistake, but she was giving careful consideration to her options. And I really liked how the whole baby thing was handled. Her brothers were very over protective of her and I did get a bit tired of their alpha male brotherly attitudes and actions. Kai, the reformed bad guy was interesting and I did find myself rooting for him and Norah from early on. I loved Kais mother and sister. I finished the book over a weekend and Ive already ordered the next book in the series. Overall, it is a formulaic romance, but it was entertaining and engaging."},

  {"id": 5188, "content": "A little unwieldy, but they get the job done... | The Corona SL 4264 loppers are longer and heavier than other loppers that we have used.  Because of that they initially seemed a little unwieldy.  Using them could probably become tiring if you had to work with them continuously for long period of time.  However, we have only used them for small jobs trimming the bushes and trees around our home, so they have been fine for us.  These Corona loppers are probably closer to being a 34real34 tool than our other loppers Fiskars.  The SL 4264 loppers are well designed and solidly built.  The blades on them are aligned well and are very sharp, which enables us to cut thicker branches than we could with our other loppers.  We used to use a pruning saw to cut branches that were over 134, but the Corona loppers can handle those up to 1 1234 at least.  These loppers make a clean and smooth cut.  The comfort grip handles make the loppers easy on the hands.  We have seen reviews of Corona loppers that stated that these tools werent as well made or as durable as they were in the past.  We have no plans to give our loppers enough heavy duty use to really put them to the test.  They seem to be more than durable enough for our occasional use of them."},

It is a fairly good fit.  I hooked comfortably on the second from the last hook perfect is hooking to the last  because the elastic stretches as you wear it  it loosens.. the cup is VERY lightly lined  which I like  no nips... the straps are adjustable and wider  a little more than 12.. But they do still cut into my shoulders partly because boobs are heavy  eh ..NO wire  which I know is appealing, BUT it isnt as lifting as a wire  so theres that.  The back strap has 4 hooks and is very wide.  NO buldging under the arm and no fat rolls in the back area  but I think part of that is going up one rib cage size.  The bra is soft and fairly comfortable...The cup coverage is full  but I still had significant cleavage  another challenge of full boobs.  It does have a little lacepretty at the V of the cleavage  but it is minimal and doesnt show under a Tshirt I tried on with it. So over all it is better than average  but not perfect in my opinion.

  {"id": 5222, "content": "No Horse Pill! | I am in my late 40s and have not been very good about taking vitamins regularly. The last few times that I have tried to donate blood, I have been turned away due to low iron. Im nearing perimenopause and Ive read that it can affect iron levels, too. So I have been looking for a multivitamin that included iron. This bottle contains 120 pills and the serving size is just one. That means its going to last for about three months. I get so frustrated when I purchase a supplement and it contains a lot of tablets, but you have to take two per serving so it ends up only lasting a month! The pill is a standard size  no horse pill. It is very easy to swallow. The bottle does have the usual quotvitaminquot smell when you open it. One thing that I have noticed and that I like is that my urine isnt bright yellow. Its definitely more yellow than when Im not taking any vitamins, but its not the bright  yellow that often comes with vitamins. Another thing I like about this supplement is that it contains the B vitamins which I have taken individually in the past.  The Bs help me with my energy levels. I have not had any issues with feeling sick after taking it. The directions say to take it with food, so I have been doing that. Overall, I am very happy with this vitamin.

I knew living in a strange place for a few months and being out of my regular routine, I would really miss the healthier meals that I would make. When I saw this Krupps grill, I was a little hesitant.  Currently living in an apartment, I didnt want to have to worry about smoke detectors going off, or anything else that might impact the building on them. From a personal perspective, I was worried that I wouldnt like the taste of the food given that Im used to growing on outdoor grills. Boy, but what a mistake I made! This is an absolutely great grill. I found very little smoke and cooking hamburgers, and they tasted great. I even think they cooked more evenly then they wouldve on the grill.  My only complaint, and thats why am removing one star, is the cleanup. I did line the pan with aluminum foil which did help. However the inside of the grill underneath the heating element. Its very difficult to clean. With the splashing of grease from the burgers it did take me a while to try to get this clean, and Im still not sure if it was 100 clean.

My teenage daughter pets sits for a few different families. Some of her clients have young, active dogs that enjoy chasing tennis balls. She plans to take this with her on dog sitting jobs for puppy playtime. It comes with a power brick so it can be plugged into the wall. You also have the option of installing 6  C batteries which are not included. It comes with three mini sized tennis balls. Regular sized tennis balls will not fit into the machine. I have never looked for mini ones before, but there seem to be several options available if you want to order more. My daughter plans to get more just in case they get lost or destroyed. At first I thought it might be better if they could accommodate standard tennis balls, but then decided that its probably better that they are smaller because larger ones might have more force or a greater impact.  You insert the balls into the machine and if its powered on, it automatically throws out the balls one at a time. You can adjust the distance the balls are thrown by pressing a button. The machine is slightly noisy when its shooting the tennis balls, but its pretty quiet the rest of the time. Some of the dogs that my daughter sits for are good about bringing the balls back. Shes hoping she can get them trained to drop it in the machine. My elderly dog wasnt too impressed with this, but we did try it with the cats. One of our cats actually enjoyed chasing the balls. Overall, this is a fun and clever pet item and my daughter is excited to take this with her pet sitting. The only thing that would make it better would be if it included batteries or could be recharged.  I received this for free in exchange for my honest amp unbiased review. My thoughts amp opinions are my own."},

Naturally, people decide to turn this into a collective consciousness, allowing anyone to watch, say, hundreds of individual experiences of a concert from 1965.  And woven throughout The Candy House is an amazing array of characters who in some way are connected to Bix who figured out this thing that changes the culture quickly, dramatically and forever.  This book is a kaleidoscope of people and experiences, families, the music industry, a band everyone knew made famous by a mentally ill exmilitary author whos sisters ex was one of the folks who spent his life counteracting the intrusion of the own your unconscious and their family took care of Lulu while her mother was in prison and she somehow is aware she has a famous father but her mother wont tell her who.  Lulus story is my favorite, weaving through the book, pure and yet traumatized, apparently repeatedly but in one part of her life she engages in public service that is captured in my favorite chapters that turned out to be a former New Yorker story  figures.  Meanwhile, Bix got his idea when he read Miranda Klines book about a Brazilian indigenous people so divorced from the rest of the world that she can study their contained social structure to  develop an algorithm and write her book Patterns of Affinity that led to the success of all social platforms.  And Miranda was once married to Lou, a record producer who had two children with each of his three wives.  Dont get me started on Lous kids or Lou or his wives...  I would love to understand, by the way, how Jennifer Egans brain works because while I find her writing and her story and her characters amazing I cant imagine being a person who could put this book and all its story lines together.  It is the journey of The Candy House, strung together with these interconnecting people at various times that makes the book, which is certainly not plot driven or chronological but makes so much sense and gives one far too much to chew on. I think.... Ill read it again."},

Its narrator, Myriam, is a talented cook with a forged resume and a past tainted with disaster. At 43, Myriam feels that her life including a failed attempt at motherhood has been a failure, and her dearth of organizational abilities always leaves her in a bind. Her latest attempt is to open a restaurant with a staff of one she doesnt want to hire waiters, cooks, or dishwashers, and she has no idea how a restaurant is run.  Despite a life tainted with tragedies, Myriam whips up extraordinary culinary concoctions that delight her audience. She shields herself from emotion with food, willing herself to forget about painful past betrayals and nearmisses. But her small restaurant, which shes christened Chez Moi My house, is her home, for she cant afford to rent an apartment and instead sleeps on the donated banquette and bathes in the large stainless steel sink.  The descriptions of food are heady and sensual, from delicate sauces to silken desserts. Ever practical, Myriam reuses things rather than throwing them out, and comes up with one menu for adults, another to cater to children.  Despite her lack of advertising Chez Moi doesnt even have a sign proclaiming its a restaurant, her creations attract a regular crowd of schoolgirls, young children, and workers. The neighboring florist Vincent, with breath that could kill an elephant, expresses romantic interest in her. When the talented waiter Ben appears, he helps Myriam by creating a website and bringing customers and a catering business. Myriam is fascinated by Bens physical awkwardness he seems to have some mild physical impairment and his asexuality finally, a strong asexual character whose personality isnt defined by his asexuality!, his broad range of knowledge, and his talent in the kitchen. Ben puts Myriam in touch with a romantic figure from her past, and this has earthshattering consequences for the timid, haunted Myriam.  There are mentions of Myriams Jewishness, although fleeting, and of her family successful little brother Charles, an eccentric aunt, and her disapproving parents, and the role that all of these characters have played in her development. Myriams past failures threaten to engulf her, until her new network of coworkers and friends gives her the ability to move on.  Beautifully told, this portrait of a haunted woman and her talent in the kitchen will be sure to delight fans of Joanne Harris and Laura Esquivel."},

Lighten up, yall! | Virginia Willis, Frenchtrained chef at Anne Willans La Varenne, is the author of several outstanding cookbooks that merge Southern cooking with French sensibilities the excellent Bon Appetit, Yall and the followup Basic to Brilliant, Yall. In her latest, Lighten Up, Yall, Willis tackles the misconception that Southern comfort food classics like pimiento cheese, mac and cheese, collard greens, fried chicken, and biscuits and gravy are relegated to a dieticians worst nightmare.  Southern cuisine relies on a bounty of fresh produce which can sometimes be hidden under added fats or oils collard greens, Im looking at you!, but that doesnt mean that its lacking in any nutritional value whatsoever. Virginia has given these staples a healthier makeover by swapping out fullfat products for lowerfat ones, including applesauce for oil in baked goods, and by substituting a portion of 2 Greek Yogurt I use 0 Fage in place of mayo. The best part is that your guests wont be able to taste the difference theres no sense of deprivation or strange textures from using fatfree products which she doesnt recommend.  Many iconic Southern classics have been given the makeover treatment, including cheese grits, dirty rice, smothered chicken and gravy, and coleslaw. In some cases, recipes are given a French or international treatment misoglazed catfish with edamame, rack of lamb with pecan mint dipping sauce. Every recipe includes nutritional info, making it great for those who actively track calories, fat, sugar and carbs. Gorgeous photos tempt you to make every recipe in the book.  I recently had the chance to take a Lighten Up, Yall class with Virginia, where we made several recipes from the book including the crab and celery remoulade wraps, makeover broccoli mac and cheese, ciderbraised pork loin with apple thyme jus, pan roasted asparagus  mushrooms, buttermilk biscuits, and  Claires cream cheese swirl brownies with vanilla cream. She was a most gracious and humorous hostess who exuded Southern charm, and these recipes are sure to be a hit at your next dinner or party.  Lighten Up, Yall should belong in everyones kitchen its not a diet book by any means, but a way to enjoy seasonal vegetables to their fullest without added fat, and to try new produce or meats that you otherwise may have been missing out on honey mustard Carolina quail with grilled grapes, okra, greens. Its a wonderful way to enjoy healthier versions of beloved classics without feeling like youre sacrificing portion size or flavor, and to try new flavors as well."},

  {"id": 5308, "content": "Moving story of Jesuss message in a modern reincarnation... |  Jeacutesus de Montreacuteal  was a stunning, thoughtprovoking film by Montreacutealais director Denys Arcand. The strong ensemble cast includes Lothaire Bluteau Le confessional, La robe noire and Robert Lepage famous Queacutebec playwright, author of N, and The Seven Streams of the River Ota. The story revolves around a series of actors Constance who works in a soup kitchen, plays Mary Magdalene and sleeps with the priest, Mireille a sexy young actress whose sole talent, according to her ex, is in her backside, Martin and Reacuteneacute, actors who dub porno films in French, and Daniel Bluteau, a fragile young actor enlisted to play Jesus in a popular passion play. Bluteau is frail and androgynous to a certain degree, lending him an angelic quality. He is extremely softspoken and I often had to turn the volume up to hear him. His voice was barely above a whisper in many of the passion play scenes and near the end. Daniel does extensive research into the life and times of Jesus, taking into account new archaeological findings. Instead of merely updating the passion play he, along with his fellow actors, rewrites it. Jesus is the son of a Roman soldier in the play, the crucifixion is performed accurately naked, with the torso twisted to the side, and the Catholic priests are upset and demand an end to the passion play on the mount. Martin works in his Hamlet soliloquy To sleep...perchance to dream... in a scene that is strangely powerful as the resurrected Jesus comes to the disciples. The normally mild mannered Daniel rebels at the treatment Mireille receives at an audition, and mirroring Jesus disruption of the moneylenders in the temple in Matthew 2112 And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of he moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold the doves. Daniel becomes irrational when the casting director Mireilles exboyfriend tells her to strip. Daniel orders her to refuse, then, flying into a rage knocks over tables, smashes cameras and monitors and causes thousands of dollars worth of damage. His life begins to mirror that of Jesus. Lothaire Bluteau was the only choice for the role of Daniel Jesus. He becomes so involved in all of his roles that he walks a dangerous line. Robert Lepage says that he embodies and expresses emotional pain better than any actor in the world. Lothaire Bluteau says of himself that he still is struggling to learn to live with the searing pain he feels for real. According to a recent interview, In person, the theatrical, charismatic, deeply analytical and cathartic Bluteau wears many emotional scars beneath his pale and skeletal physical armour. His immersion into the characters that have inhabited not only his physical being, but his emotional thoughts and each waking moment are the very extension of himself into some intangible realms. He readily admits that these fictional characters are always awaiting his presence to fill them and breathe life into their troubled existences. Ask Bluteau if he finds it difficult to achieve a separation point between the characters her portrays and himself and he frowns Sometimes I think Im getting better at not drowning in the emotional sadness and the fear I have when I start working on a film or play. When you are enriched by your characters life, you do tend to share a lot of things together. They will call upon your emotions and leave you with souvenirs and old scars, that you manage to survive from. The character wants to borrow that pain, and of course there is a transformation and collar of sadness that you are attached to. So he is ultimately believable as a modernday Jesus, preaching to the crowds at a Montreacuteal subway station, chasing the money lenders out of the studio, and finally sacrificing his life so that others may live through him. The final scenes are unspeakably powerful as Daniels message lives on. There are moments of humour as well, irreverence towards Catholic doctrine and its unwillingness to change. When the priest informs them that they have to revert to the original script, Martin, Reacuteneacute, Constance and Mireille begin an absurdly funny adlib update of the passion play. First Constance recites a line and makes it sound like a line from a porno dub, then Mireille turns it into une comeacutedie franaise, Martin tries New York method acting, Reacuteneacute vulgar joual, and Martin and Reacuteneacute do a Kabuki version that had me in tears. It was the funniest thing I had seen in years. There are similar lighthearted moments between the actorsfriends, but much of the story has a sombre tone. The cinematography is spectacular, with enticing shots of Montreacuteal at work and at play. The nighttime scenes are particularly effective, as are the passion play scenes. The music is sparse but haunting an aria from Pergolesis Stabat Mater that is sung at the end over the credits, and during the passion play we hear haunting music from Le mystegravere des voix bulgares. There is some nudity, although it is not sexual. There is a lot of offensive language, especially during the improv passion play, and during the porno dubbing scene which is hilarious in a sad way. This is not a film for those who are devoutly religious or easily offended. The film is subtitled in English with French subtitles over the English dialogue.   Jeacutesus de Montreacuteal  explores the story of Jesus, updates it, gives it a fresh young face in the form of Daniel. What would happen if Jesus reappeared in the world today? Denys Arcand explores this through multiple Biblical parallels and imagery and a stellar supporting cast, also using the film as a vehicle to express his distaste of the allconsuming media and material greed. We see the transformation of a group of ordinary actors into Biblical beings who are profoundly changed by DanielsJesuss presence in their lives. This film will leave you thinking for hours afterwards."},

Out of box, I liked the heavy construction. Included batteries were easy to install Ive had some scales that were nearly impossible to remove  access the battery compartment, so thats a plus. I like the feel of the glass top, and the ease of cleaning.  However, my least favorite feature is one of the selling points the pullout display. The construction of the lone wirecable holding the digital display in place feels a little flimsy Im not opposed to a pullout feature, but would have rather had something that slides out mine ended up dangling off the edge of the counter as I had the scale at the very edge as I have very narrow counters and limited counter space.  Measurements seem accurate enough, although I would have liked a little more precision as I would occasionally weigh the same item twice and get slightly different readings. There is also no 34tare34 display to let you know the scale is in tare mode once hitting zero. Measurements include oz., fluid oz., pounds, grams, and mL.  As a battery saving feature, when you put the pull out display away, it seems to shut the unit off, which I liked. Also, the display stays on for a LONG time maybe 5 minutes?, which is helpful when youre trying to prep, measure and weigh several items in a row without having to constantly reboot  tare the unit.  Overall, this will see a lot of use in my kitchen and I love the sturdy glass top and ease of cleaning. It is much thicker than my previous digital scale, but still slides neatly or on its side to take up little space."},

From making costumes fom plays I was in myself, to making Halloween costumes for my sons, my old Singer got a lot of practice. Now 20 years later, I havent used a sewing machine and thought this would be a good refresher for me preparation for my future grandchildren, lol. Anyway, the positives The Singer 6199 is much more compact than anything I owned or used in the past. It is sleek, attractive and a piece of home equipment I am proud to desktop display. The stitches are tight and secure and changing the stitch patterns is easy. The downside, was the bobbin loading. I am not sure if it was me since I am so out of practice or not. In reading other reviews I see there are others probably with more recent experience having the same issues. It took me quite a while the first time to load and level, after painstakingly having to follow instructions. You will need a lot of patience at least the first few times. Anyway. I still recommend this sewing machine as it produces a quality finish and has a lot of features I havent even tried yet but will be over the next few months."},

  {"id": 5354, "content": "Definitely some pros and cons | This envelope making board has its pros and cons. I had purchased the original gray design with white lettering about 4 years ago. Although the print is small, I could read it without any issue at all. Then when I spotted the new pretty blue and white punch board I thought why not. I use my old one so much that I thought it would be nice to have a much prettier one, ong with a new punch blade to justify my senseless purchase. Big mistake! The pretty new design is extremely difficult to read the tiny print. The background color is blue with white font. I never struggle to read anything, but I do with this. My suggestion is that if you are also having an issue reading yours, just print the measurements out on a piece of paper to store away with the board. The other issue I have is that when making the larger envelopes, the board itself is not large enough to accommodate your paper. And I mean for envelopes only like 4x6 or larger. The paper hangs off the board so you cant score the entire paper. I have made 100 envelopes of all sizes so it can be done regardless, but sometimes my score lines are off a bit because of this and I end up with a crooked envelope that cant be fixed. So I end up having to throw the wonky envelope one in my scrap pile for another project. PROS Despite all mentioned above, I still find this method far easier that cutting everything by hand, which I did for years before the board. Initially I thought there was something wrong with the design because all my envelopes came out wrong. I watched a YouTube video and got the hang of it after making 34 envelopes and now its a breeze and the process is very fast. My 3 star review is because the new color combination is hard to read for some. And another star dinged because this really needs to be on a larger board platform. Us crafters spend our  like crazy on our hobby, so why not make a larger version for 10 more. I sure would buy it! Dont take the reviews seriously that say it doesnt work. They just dont have patience and the willingness to learn something new. Quitters never win "},

He quickly becomes acquainted with his circus family the performers acrobats, lion tamers, human cannonball, and brings the reader along on a fascinating journey into a vanishing world confrontations with animal rights groups become more and more frequent as the season progresses.

  {"id": 5374, "content": "Delicious and easy way to eat your veggies youll never miss the fish! | Izumi Shoji, Japanese housewife and mother, is the hugely successful vegetarian blogger, author, and owner of the Izumi Shoji Cooking School in Tokyo. Izumi decided to become vegetarian after the birth of her daughter twentyone years ago through a gradual transition to vegetarianism. Believing that vegetable dishes are colorful, bright, and beautiful and more forgiving than cooking meat dishes, she started her blog in 2007 as there were no Japaneselanguage cookbooks on vegetarian cooking available at that time. By writing a successful blog, she hoped to publish a book on vegetarian cooking. Now with over fifty books published in Japanese, The Vegetable Sushi Cookbook is her first title to be translated into English.  I was so excited when I heard that Kodansha was publishing her vegetarian sushi cookbook in English as a longtime vegetarian living in Japan, Ive been unable to enjoy most types of sushi as most contain seafood. The few exceptions available to vegetarians are natto, gourd, and cucumber rolls, omelet, and inarizushi, a fried tofu pouch stuffed with plain rice. Vegetable sushi is just now catching on here but is perhaps more a novelty than anything else popular chain Sushi Nova introduced some similar vegetable but not vegetarian one contains prosciutto sushi on its menu last year, but purely vegetarian rolls are still a rarity in the land of seafood.  The more than 100 recipes in The Vegetable Sushi Cookbook include many popular types of sushi including nigirizushi, makizushi, chirashizushi, gunkanzushi, oshizushi, temarizushi, mazezushi and inarizushi and show off Japanese veggies and herbs to their best advantage, including my personal favorites renkon lotus root, eggplant, takenoko baby bamboo, gobo burdock, enoki, eringi, and shiitake mushrooms, turnips, leeks, etc. If youre a fan of mouthpuckering umeboshi pickled plums, youre in luck there are many recipes punched up with umeboshi, including the shiitake steamed with umeboshi plum mazezushi, umeboshi plum and gingerflavored turnip nigirizushi, asparagus and umeboshi plum makizushi. Youll find fullcolor photographs and detailed instructions on making great sushi rice the most important part of making sushi instructions are given for rice cooker and clay pot methods, simple steps to extract the most flavor from a wide range of Japanese veggies, and additional side dishes that complement the sushi. A beautifully photographed ingredients and tools glossary will make it easy to take the book along to your nearest Asian  Japanese supermarket to purchase potentially unfamiliar items.  This was my first attempt at making sushi, so with nervous anticipation, I purchased the ingredients for the steamed enoki mushroom gunkanmaki p. 39, gingered bamboo shoot nigirizushi p. 37, and mustardflavored cabbage temarizushi p. 69. As I live in Japan, I am fortunate to have abundant access to ultrafresh Japanese veggies and herbs, but dont worry even if you cant find uniquely Japanese ingredients like lotus root, there are plenty of recipes calling for staples like cabbage, mushrooms both fresh and dried, carrots, asparagus, tomatoes, etc. Some of the recipes call for Western ingredients like balsamic vinegar I used the amazing Fustinis 18year balsamic from my home state of Michigan.  Each recipe yields a small number of rolls usually around three to four because the recipes are so simple, its no trouble to double or triple a recipe if you anticipate a crowd. Ingredients are listed in both US and metric. Instructions are clear and concise, and some include stepbystep photos makizushi, for example. I had no problems in following along and producing appealing sushi see photos!. My favorite of the three Ive tried so far was definitely the cabbageflavored mustard I loved the flavor so much I made a cabbage mustard salad out of the remaining head of cabbage! If you dont have access to precut nori here in Japan, you can purchase already trimmed nori designed for onigiri, musubi, gunkanmaki, etc., be sure to use a very sharp knife or the nori will tear instead of cutting neatly. I found that scoring with a chefs knife then bending at the score was also a good technique.  Many of the recipes call for no special equipment, but its worth investing in a few staples used to make sushi, such as a bamboo makisu sushi rolling mat Lekue also makes a great ASINB000PKRSO6 Lekue Silicone Makisu Mat, Clear that I use in combination with a bamboo makisu as cleaning is much easier, plastic rice paddle ASINB00DV52ZXG Kotobuki Swing Shamoji Serving Rice Paddle if you already have an electric Japanesestyle rice cooker, it should have come with one if not, they are inexpensive, and an ASINB000CPR2H2 1 X Japanese Plastic Oshizushi Press Sushi Box Mold if you plan on making pressed sushi I opted for this plastic one for ease of cleaning, but you can also find beautiful wooden presses made in Japan.  I love that such unique and healthy rolls can be produced with literally any vegetables in your crisper youll find ideas for radishes, celery, avocado, carrots, cabbage, etc. with minimal ingredients and prep, preserving the natural colors, flavors and nutrients of the veggies and showing them off to their best advantage. Its a fun way to incorporate more veggies into your diet, and if you have children in your house, many of these recipes can be adapted for younger helpers once the veggies are simmered  steamed, etc. My copy of The Vegetable Sushi Cookbook is flagged with dozens of other sushi recipes I cant wait to try highly recommended!

Lucas is stuck trying to keep his job and is being controlled by his stepfather to do his bidding. Romi wants to keep running the business in honor of her grandparents hard work.

Matt and Brooklyn were friends for over two years because Brooklyn was afraid of losing her best friend. Matt patiently waited for the woman that he knew was the one. Although the plot read like a typical love story the execution was superb. The writing was complex, honest, factual and complete. I didnt have the urge to slam my kindle against the wall because of grammatical errors, piecemeal writing or undeveloped characters. This book is print worthy and if youre an ebook reader you should understand what that is... I would give up a section of my bookcase to a print copy of this series.

A lot of wigs come very long sometimes and honestly I think this came in at exactly the right size, now again I do have a very big forehead and head in general so I wouldnt know how it would fit a smaller person but I think the wig is awesome because it just doesnt move too much which is great already. The bangs look exactly like the anime on front so no need to make any adjustments to it at all honestly. Overall great experience with this maybe I will buy some wig glue later just to make sure but I highly doubt I will need it maybe just cause I am crazy and dont want it falling off randomly but probably wont be needing more than some bobby pins."},

It opens with street food and snacks, and moves on to seafood, meat, vegetables, rice and noodles, pudding and drinks, and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages, while the goldembossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  Youll find street snack favorites like chicken satay, net pancakes, roti canai, and fried spring rolls, along with Indian lentil patties, grilled fish paste in banana leaf, tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables, and the gorgeous Kak Besahs curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass, ginger and chilies, squid stir fry, and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef no pork unlike Pings book, with lamb curry, beef rendang, and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad, which features rice noodles, tofu beansprouts, and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs if you are vegetarian, leave out the shrimp paste and prawns. I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry, pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk, and eggs in chili sambal think shakshuka.  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice nasi tomato, wokfried flat noodles, curry laksa, chicken rice, herbal rice, and several eggfried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless fresh mango, honey and coconut, tropical fruit salad to the more elaborate pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet, sticky rice balls, soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And youll find any number of refreshing drinks, from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments, from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals chili, coconut, sauces, and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musas recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex, nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!"},

Like with any guidebook, its impossible to fit every attraction, historical site, restaurant, etc. into a single volume, but Frommers Japan Day by Day does a decent job at covering the main points castles, museums, hot springs, temples and shrines, along with sample itineraries depending on how much time you have available. Youll find the mandatory blurbs on manga, anime, and pop culture maid cafes, Studio Ghibli museum, etc., but also some unique additions like Japanese ghost and monster myths. Theres also a brief, twopage overview of the damage caused by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku.  Not surprisingly, the book kicks off with Tokyo and Mount Fuji. Youll find the prerequisite mention of the ninja museum, along with cormorant fishing on the Kiso River I didnt get to witness this firsthand, unfortunately!. I lived quite close to Nagoya, and their suggested sites are quite good Nagoya Castle, Tokugawa art museum and gardens, Noritake Garden, Nagoya Aquarium, Atsuta Jingu. Frommers seemed to focus on smaller cities that I didnt see listed in the other guidebooks I used around Japan ASIN0307480496 Fodors Japan Fullcolor Travel Guide, ASIN1848366159 The Rough Guide to Japan Rough Guide Japan. Some of their restaurant suggestions were interesting falafel and Italian in the ancient capital of Nara, for example. I would have liked to see more space devoted to Kyoto, but each city generally only gets two or three pages of suggested sites with the exception of Tokyo and Osaka. Also, the editing could have been improved the numerous sidebars and inserts frequently broke up text and made the book feel disjointed and cluttered.  The most glaring omission, as other reviewers have mentioned, was that of Takayama in the Japan Alps. Its included on all the maps, but nary a mention of Gero a famous spa town, Takayama famous for its sake breweries and traditional wooden townhouses, or Shirakawago famous for its towering thatchedroof farmhouses. Its too bad, since Takayama in particular has an astounding collection of Art Nouveau glassware by Tiffany, Daum, Galle, etc. and Art Nouveau furniture.  From my own experiences traveling around Japan, I preferred ASIN0307480496 Fodors Japan Fullcolor Travel Guide for its background on important sites and ASIN1848366159 The Rough Guide to Japan Rough Guide Japan for its offthebeaten path suggestions and activities I located several great cooking classes and activities this way Japan Day by Day is serviceable, but it felt too cluttered and difficult to navigate for quickly locating a city and its sights."},

His grandmother and her Grandma Beans have been locked in a feud for decades, so Dani is sure thats the reason behind Maxs strange behavior.

Music for Native American Flute Vol. 1 showcases 41 songs from around the globe adapted for Native American flute tablature, most in the key of G.  There are songs from all corners of the globe from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, England, Italy, Greece, Russia, medieval Spain, Israel, Palestine, Syria, Japan, Canada, First Nations Ojibway, America, Peru, and Ecuador, all adapted for the range and voice of Native American flute. Each tune is described in the front of the book, its country of origin, and a bit about the tunes history. There is also an audio CD that features all 41 songs, so you can listen as you readplay along. Normally associated with First Nations music, the Native American flute is a virtual chameleon here, taking on the breathiness of a Syrian nay, the haunting song of the Andean panpipes, the dulcet tones of a Medieval recorder. The amazing feat is that a simple instrument that is generally heard in First NationsNew Age music in a muchsimplified context has, thanks to Jessica Walsh, pushed the envelope into a virtuosic instrument capable of handling European airs, dance, and Eastern laments. I cant wait until a Vol. 2 is released, hopefully with more Eastern Indian, Chinese, Middle Eastern flavour."},

As far as athletic pullovers go, this is pretty good. Its midweight and will provide adequate warmth in the fallspring, possibly even enough for mild winters in the south. The outer material is a polyester waffle weave type fabric. The inside is a soft fleece material. The zippers are heavy grade and zip well. The chest pocket is the only pocket on the garment. It is not large enough to accommodate most cellphones. The Tennessee logo is made of cloth and is embroidered onto the pullover. My husband is 6234 and weighs about 195 pounds. He wears mediums and larges in shirts. This fits him fine with a little bit of room so he could wear a layer underneath. The sleeve length is fine, too. His does not have the large manufacturer 34C34 on the lower left front, but there is a smaller 34Crable34 tag on the back of the collar."},

Good idea, but... youll need to make sure your eyes are completely clean and free of any moisturizer including whatever you used to clean your eyes with.  I purchased this set that has one set that is a bit more and one that is a little more flair  but even the one with more flair was barely visible. So theres that.  But Im getting ahead of myself... removing them from the case was a bit of nightmare  they were stuck together  right and left  so that took several minutes to detach them from each other  I didnt want to tear off the self sticking stuff.  Once you do that you can place them fairly easily on  the inside corners of each eye is the hardest part to get right  but the self sticky stuff will allow some adjustment. So, once they are on  they were very uncomfortable  really stiff and you feel every blink  even after wearing for hours.  I think because the self sticky is so thick. For me they are a no  but I had hoped.  I gave them a really good try.  They do come in a nice container  remember to keep the right and left eyes apart!  I just cannot recommend these. UPDATE  I was emailed an offer to change my review in exchange for a total of 41.00.  Sorry, my integrity isnt for sale.  My review is an honest one.  In the offer they gave a long list of instructions, which I had already followed and failed with.

  {"id": 5486, "content": "Disneys most eloquent, spiritual score to date. | Pocahontas 1995 was my favorite Disney film, partly because I spent parts of my childhood in Jamestown, VA, and mostly because Ive always been an active advocate of Native American culture Im a past member of NASONAISO, Ive volunteered at powwows, taught lessons on Canadian First Nations tribes, attempted to teach myself the Native American flute, and have readwatched a great deal of Native American literaturecinema.  Pocahontas was penned by the formidable team of Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, and is balanced between musical numbers Virginia Company, Steady as the Beating Drum, Just Around the Riverbend, Listen With Your Heart, If I Never Knew You and beautiful instrumental interludes. Many of the instrumentals are interwoven with Native American influences like cedar flute, drum, and rattles. Earlier melodies are cleverly reprised in the short segments. My only complaint would be the outoforder tracklisting Ive rearranged mine to follow the movie.  Pocahontas has not only one, but two great love themes Colors of the Wind, a plea to conserve and cherish natural resources, and If I Never Knew You, a song that was cut from the original film but restored in the 10th anniversary edition although here, Jon Secada and Shanice duet instead of Mel Gibson and Judy Kuhn. Similar to Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King Peabo BrysonCeline Dion and Elton John, Disney again chose to include popular artists reprising the hit songs, so Vanessa Williams Colors of the Wind and Jon Secada If I Never Knew You are included as the final tracks.  Balanced between the European and Native American cultures in the film, most of the score shows a marked Native American musical influence Steady as the Beating Drum and reprise, Listen With Your Heart, Pocahontas, Council Meeting, Getting Acquainted, Picking Corn, while the other half incorporates European musical themes.  It seems that Disney included much more of the original score than on previous soundtracks, and for that Ill always be grateful. Pocahontass score is a symbolic, symphonic blending of cultures and mindsets, and you discover new nuances with every listen.  Easily my favorite score of any film after Somewhere in Time and the Ghost and Mrs. Muir. Kids will enjoy the colorful, loud showtunes like Mine, Mine, Mine and the Virginia Company, and adults will appreciate the delicate phrasing, soothing flute and strings, and emotional lyrics of Colors of the Wind and If I Never Knew You."},

I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish theyd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, youd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have 34tested34 that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear  for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues. UPDATE 6292015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this 34shape34 of earbud doesnt want to stay in my ear... tiny ears? but these DO stay in..

The keyboard does everything that my Samsung remote does for example, switches between apps, sources, calls up the TV settings menu, although it takes a bit of experimentation to learn how to use it.  The direction keys near the touchscreen allow you to navigate the TV screen and everything else.  If you go to the TVs Internet area, the touchscreen activates and you see a big arrow cursor that works like a mouse.  The keyboard does the one thing that I really wanted. It has a Search button that allows me to search for TV shows, movies, etc. by typing on the keyboard, instead of by navigating around letterbyletter on an onscreen letterpad.  The keyboard does NOT work when Im using Roku for searches, but thats normal because the keyboard is designed to connect directly to a Smart TV not to the TVs connected accessories.

It is not quite as simple as a single lever kitchen sink faucet this is intended for a bathroom.  You will need some simple tools and plumbers putty if you do attempt it yourself.  I gave this 5stars just because of quality and the looks havent gotten it installed yet, but I suspect that it wouldnt take long for a good plumber.  If you only dabble with simple plumbing, plan on this taking a full day or more.  Note includes a new popup drain too.

As a baker at The Neal Street Restaurant, he was responsible for making the bread, focaccia, torte salate, pastry and seasonal bakes. As he mentioned in the foreword, bread and baked goods mean tradition, and youll find various bakes from across Italy and in honor of various seasons and holidays.  Beginning with basic bread dough and grissini, youll find recipes for panini, stuffed breads, focaccia garlic and rosemary, cheese, peppers, potato, red onion and pancetta, pizze Bianca, marinara, 4cheese, greens, individual pizzas, stuffed pies spinach, guanciale, courgette and ricotta, sweet breads plaited sweetbread, aniseed and currant ring cake, pandoro, brioche, colomba, crostate tarts ricotta and Nutella, dried apricot, strawberry and peach, creamy limoncello tart with grated chocolate, pumpkin, biscotti, cantucci, and torte pear and chocolate, polenta and almond cake, yogurt and orange ring cake, marbled espresso loaf cake. Many of the recipes are influenced by Tuscany including autumnal favorite castagnaccio, and youll note that some recipes do not include salt as is traditional  so you may choose to add at your own discretion. Ingredients are listed in metric as well as US volume and weight measurements, a thoughtful touch that makes it much easier for US bakers. And many recipes feature gorgeous matte photographs of the final bakes.  For this review, I made three recipes, including the grape and rosemary buns, tricolor braided loaf, and the aniseed and currant cake.  The grape and rosemary buns did not include salt in the recipe, and I would definitely add about  tsp next time as the sweetness of the grapes could use the balance from a pinch of salt. Also, the shaping instructions were rather vague form the dough into little basket shapes and I must have rolled mine too tightly as I could not get my dough spirals to resemble the photo, but they were delicious nonetheless and froze beautifully.  The second recipe I tried was the treccia colorata, with three different flavors saffron walnut, rum raisin, chocolate and orange. This was extremely timeconsuming start to finish, it was a fourhour project and messy, and I felt like I may have overworked the dough trying to knead in the cocoa powder after the first rise  next time, I would add in the flavoring during the initial mixing  kneading by dividing the dough before the first rise. The final loaf was a touch dry, but made fantastic toast and looked gorgeous on the table.  The final recipe and my personal favorite of the three was the aniseed and currant ring cake. I was happily surprised to find both currants and Sambuca widely available here in Japan, and set out to make the cake I used a 10cup NordicWare Bundt pan. This was the easiest recipe of the three, and very easy to assemble it only requires a brief knead. The final texture was delightfully soft, fragrant, and makes fantastic toast.  My next challenge will be the chestnut squares as chestnuts are in season here in Japan in fact, one of my former students gifted me with some gorgeous chestnuts from his tree, so I look forward to baking with them.  Overall, Gennaros Italian Bakery is a delightful addition to your baking library that fans of Italian breads and pastries will definitely want to own! Note I reviewed the UK edition, but Interlink is also releasing an adapted version for US home bakers in the near future."},

  {"id": 5553, "content": "Stopped Working.  SignalBlocking Pouch Protects Cars With Keyless Entry Systems | UPDATE  One year later, I retested this item, and it has stopped working.  My car starts even though the car key fob is inside the Faraday bag.  Another of these, purchased at the same time but used only to shield a second car key fob stored in a drawer, is still blocking the fob signal so that my car wont start.  Star rating downgraded from 5 stars to 1 star, because of lack of durability and need to regularly retest for effectiveness.  This UPGRADED TICONN PREMIUM FARADAY BAG FOR KEY FOB 2 Pack completely blocks the signal from my 2019 Honda Accord key fob.  When the transmitter is inside the bag, and inside the car, the car absolutely will NOT start.  Just make sure that you place the fob in the BACK pocket the one with the white lining.  The front pocket does NOT block the signal.  Keyless car entry systems like those on the newer Hondas make the cars that are equipped with them much harder to steal.  However, thieves with sophisticated tech knowledge and equipment can enter or steal these cars by 1 hacking the fobs with signal boosting software, or 2 capturing the fob signal as the driver walks away, using special equipment developed by auto manufacturers.  If you always store your fob inside a metal box or a signalblocking pouch like this one, you are protected from these kinds of thieves.  You definitely need to store the fob inside the pouch even when the fob is inside your home.  Other reviewers say that signalblocking pouches stop working after a time, so be sure to test the pouch every so often to verify that its still working.  This pouch is large enough to easily store my Honda fob and an attached keychain charm.  Theres room left over."},

Once together, they feel very sturdy.  They are the perfect size for our little guys and will be for several years.  They have wonderful cloth bags with zippers and elastic bands to secure the pipes and pieces securely.  The bags have heavy duty handles.  They are fairly heavy  but the bags and handles make it easier to lift and move them.  We chose the turquoise  very nice and true turquoise.  The side organizers are just wonderful and I think the boys are going to love those too  they will hold the tablets, books, a small night light and other things nicely.

It was so easy.  And the zippered canvas casebags are the bomb.  So So So easy to store.  I am super impressed.  The boys, 5 and 8, loved them.

The first forty pages or so are devoted to an excellent, indepth coffee primer, which includes a brief history of coffee, coffee talk flavor notes and adjectives used to describe coffees, similar to wine tasting, growing regions, brewing tips, a section devoted solely to espresso, and types of coffee pots.  The included coffee recipes cover European territory such as Viennese coffees fiaker, spiced mocha, Irish coffee, cafeacute brulot from New Orleans, and more farflung variations such as Vietnamese and Thai  iced coffee, along with a DIY frappe recipe ice cream, espresso and whole milk and an espresso martini.  As for the baking half, its kicked off by an excellent baking primer that would be helpful for novice bakers in particular. Theres indepth discussion of ingredients, equipment, baking and cooling, and decorating. The cake recipes are divided into four parts. If youre looking for comfort food, youll find heirloom recipes like applecranberry ginger loaf from the authors grandmother, almond blueberry buckle, or cinnamon swirl coffee cake. For the kids and kids at heart, theres a section devoted to cupcakes and frosting. Gracious Southernstyle cakes include ambrosia coconut cake and spice layer cake with praline frosting. Youll also find new favorites like a Smores cheesecake and chocolate cake with chocolate malt frosting.  The first recipe that I tried was the applecranberry ginger loaf I wrote the author to make sure that 2 cups unsweetened applesauce and 12 cup butter was correct, since that seemed like a lot of liquid for one loaf. Rick confirmed that it was. I made it minus the stick of butter in the interest of making the recipe lowfat and upped the ginger to 12 cup, and was rewarded with a moist, fruitstudded spice cake that would make a beautiful gift if baked in a decorative loaf pan like ASINB000QYN19M Nordic Ware  Pumpkin Loaf Pan.  Rick advises baking in a 9 x 5 pan, or youll end up with extra batter. The applecranberry ginger loaf would also make great muffins for those chilly mornings on the go.  The Europeanstyle cakes are where the book really shines, and they pair wonderfully with Viennese coffees such as the fiaker for more of Ricks European coffee recipes, try to find a copy of the excellent and outofprint Kaffeehaus. Black Forest cake, moaahaccino torte, hazelnut gateau with coffee buttercream, chocolatestrawberry sachertorte, and tiramisu cake with mascarpone frosting will transport your tastebuds on a culinary vacation. The book wraps up with a handy if brief list of online sources, including Amazon.  Coffee and Cake does run on the short side at only eleven coffee recipes and twentyfive for cake, but Ricks excellent primers, engaging writing style, and stepbystep instructions make this a good choice for a novice baker, or for the hostess of a coffee or book club its the perfect size to tuck into a gift basket. There are numerous beautifullystaged photos that show off the included recipes. Its also printed in the US, which is becoming a rarity these days. More experienced bakers will want to try Ricks Kaffeehaus if you can find it, Doris Greenspans ASIN0618443363 Baking From My Home to Yours or Carole Walters ASIN0307237559 Great Coffee Cakes, Sticky Buns, Muffins  More 200 Anytime Treats and Special Sweets for Morning to Midnight."},

  {"id": 5609, "content": "My OPINION of this book | As with most books from this author, we have suspense, plenty of romance and excellent character development. Shay grows up in a house of demons and discovers that she isnt a demon but a messenger Angel, also the boy who she thought of as her older brother is actually her soul mate. The story goes on to introduce long lost family and all the drama and death that comes with that. I enjoyed the writing and how the revelation about who they are is written. The subject matter is not geared towards young adult, there is a lot of violence, gore, descriptive sex scenes, and references to under 18 intimacy that are not appropriate for most. That being said I enjoyed the story immensely. My only negative was that the ending felt rushed and anticlimactic. We had this amazing fight scene and then...nothing. for me it didnt do the story justice. I still would highly recommend this book and author."},

  {"id": 5619, "content": "Better than I was expecting | I was really hesitant to purchase these due to the iffy reviews on the other styles that are carried by this company, seemed that the sizing was very off for them. So after about 2 months of sitting on my wishlist I decided to go for it. Im normally a size 8 in underwear or LXL, depending on the style and ordered an XL on these. Like I said, I was really hesitant since they said to order a size up and im pretty much on the cusp between L and XL, but these actually fit pretty well. The material is a lot better than I was expecting and they arent too tight. It does not cover as much of the back as I was expecting, but that is due more so to my butt size than the undies, lol. Only real complaint is the color variety. I got 2 pairs of dark pinkpurple. 1 pair of BRIGHT yellow, 1 pair of a lighter hot pink. 2 pairs of a turqiouse blue, 2 pair of heather gray, 2 pair of white and 2 pair of this peachy color. The colors are ok, just wish it had more variety and not so many repeated colors, maybe a pair of black, red and green mixed in or something. But really for the price, its a pretty good deal"},

All in all these pants are great and so comfortable, I liked that they are not as thin as other brands or just normal pants they are a bit thicker but without being uncomfortable or hot, they are super breathable and stretchy and the material is awesome imo, it is soft and easy to wear and perfect for lounging at home doing yoga or exercising even because they are stretchy enough to exercise with as well, I think these are the perfect pants I may buy another two pairs in fact I loved them so much! I just have to check if they shrink after washing them a while just in case. But overall these pants are the best!!! Again they do run a little bigger specially at the bottom so make sure to order your usual size or even a size down they also run big at the top as well they are very stretchy and come up pretty high as well.

The seat meets the new standard of a hard head support instead of just a cushion.  This is a great safety feature.

  {"id": 5686, "content": "Nice! | Ive wanted a collapsible wagon for a while. I used to work with a couple of women who each owned a couple of them. They proved to be invaluable at times!! This one is a little different than their wagons. The first noticeable difference, is that you can pull or push this wagon because there are separate handles on each end. Another difference is that this one has the features on one of the pairs of wheels that allows the wagon to stand upright without having to lean against a surface. There was a small instruction sheet included with the wagon that said to attach the tape at the bottom of the wagon. There was no tape and we werent really sure what it was talking about. We decided it was a translation issue and that they were referring to a velcro strap. The directions didnt say how to attach it and we really couldnt figure it out. We thought it might be an aid so you can pull on it in the center of the wagon to raise the inside of the wagon up so you can fold it. When we tried to do that, the strap always came undone. It could be folded or unfolded without that feature, so we werent worried about it. My husband said he will put a large ziptie there and it should do the same job. Overall, the wagon is very sturdy and I would definitely call it heavy duty. Im not sure how I lasted so long without one!"},

When I get cozy with a blanket for a quick nap or for comfort, I want it to cover me... including toes  so this is good for me.  But to be fair, it is in no way a 34throw34 size at 9034x9034. It fits on my queen size bed easily as a full blanket.  It is 100 polyester.  It machine washed and dried nicely and I dont have a fancy washing machine and dryer.  To me, the 34sherpa34 side is actually a lot softer than the 34fur34 side.  I have included a couple of pictures... it is a light, soft ivory color in my opinion, no yellow tones  but not fully white.  I took a pic with my quilt which has white in it so you can kind of compare the color. It is what I would consider a medium weight when on you.. not super thick, but plenty warm and cozy. Having said that, it is quite heavy holding it all in one arm full.  I prefer the 34sherpa34 size to my skin.  The 34fur34 side does have a slight 34swirl34 effect in pattern.  It is my opinion that you will want to carefully care for this blanket so you dont have to wash it too many times...I think the sherpa side may become lumpy and pilly... time will tell.

It has compiled 80 vegetarian NOT vegan menus that can be put together in 20 minutes, perfect for the hectic weeknight cook.  You prepare the entree with the help of storebought convenience foods such as hardboiled eggs from the salad bar, presliced veggies, and prewashed salad greens, and round out the meal with other convenience foods  storebought bread, cookies, etc.  The book is divided into five chapters sandwich and pizza menus, soup and stew menus, maindish salad menus, egg and vegetable menus, and pasta and grain menus.  A sample menu is Warm pita pockets with mushroom and zucchini frittata, tomato, feta, and basil salad, and chocolate pudding with pecans. You assemble the frittata, and while it is cooking, you make the salad. For dessert, you simply spoon the refrigerated chocolate pudding into bowls and top with pecans. What could be easier? Healthier, definitely. Easier? Not by much.  I loved the inclusion of ethnic vegetarian menus such as white gazpacho from Spain, avoglemono stew from Greece, and Indianinspired curried rice and vegetables. There are also numerous Middle Easterninspired recipes such as Lentil salad with goat cheese, olives, and oranges, and Bulghur with currants, chickpeas, and zucchini.  The ingredients are clearly listed and divided into two categories shopping list, and from your pantry. From your pantry includes staples like butter, eggs, salt and pepper, herbs, and olive oil. If an item is to be presliced, it tells you what area of the store to find it in Presliced button mushrooms from the produce department. At the top of each recipe each is conveniently spread across two pages is a hint or tip from one of the Minutemeals chefs. Also included is a Lucky for You blurb at the bottom of the lefthand page that gives pointers on how to prepare meals quickly. Stepbystep instructions are highlighted in the middle of the page, so you always know what you should be working on at a given moment in order to have all the components ready at the same time.  There is also a nutritional analysis for each menu, but it only covers the entree, not the storebought sides, which can be confusing at first glance. Also, most of the recipes are loaded with butter and fat, often 25 g or more a serving, so if youre looking for an easytoprepare, lowfat vegetarian cookbook, check out Donna Kleins excellent ASIN1557884382 The PDQ Pretty Darn Quick Vegetarian Cookbook 240 Healthy and Easy NoPrep Recipes for Busy Cooks."},

If you open it up like a book, there are 4 342page34 layouts. There are several different ways you can organize  store stuff. I love the stretchable elastic strips which are very versatile. You can keep things separated but easily accessible. Were going out of town over the holiday break  I cant wait to organize all of the chargers and stuff!!! The material is strong  sturdy and it is very well constructed. All seams are straight  there are no weak spots. The zippers move easily, too. Plus, I love the addition of the paracord on the zipper pull! You never know when you might need some!  I received this for the purpose of trying out  reviewing. My thoughts  opinions are my own."},

  {"id": 5778, "content": "Brings vegetables and whole grains back into the spotlight where they belong! | Like many Greeks, Aglaia Kremezi grew up eating mostly vegetarian food foraged greens, garden vegetables, beans of all kinds, fruity olive oil, and local cheeses and yogurt. Until recently, this was a typical Greek diet meat was traditionally a rare and expensive commodity reserved for Sundays and holidays daily meat consumption is still a relatively new phenomenon in Greece and thus Greeks were mainly vegetarians out of necessity.  Kremezi owns a cooking school in Greece called Kea Artisanal, and is the author of the popular The Foods of Greece and Mediterranean Hot and Spicy. Her newest cookbook Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts contains 150 simple, yet abundantly flavorful, plantbased seasonal dishes from Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, France, and Italy. Sample seasonal menu suggestions offer a wide range of options, including several buffet spreads and onepot family meals. Recipes are conveniently labeled as vegan andor glutenfree when applicable, and ingredients are given in American and metric measurements. There is a comprehensive list of online and mail order sources to ensure that you have the necessary ingredients on hand. In the spirit of Mediterranean cuisine, use only what is freshest and in season Kremezi suggests that you go to your local farmers market without a recipe or shopping list in hand, choose the seasonal produce that inspires you, and only then search the pages that follow for a recipe that will showcase your fresh ingredients.  The book begins with a chapter on basic preparations and techniques. Here you will find an arsenal of herbs, seasonings, pickles and preserves that will allow you to quickly transform a dish. Youll also find an excellent guide to preparing and storing various types of leafy greens. Meze are the star of the show, including dips and spreads, salads, and baked and fried vegetables. If you are planning an allmeze meal my favorite kind!, start with spreads, pickles, and cold vegetable dishes, then finish with the warm plates. Kremezi suggests serving meze with ouzo or white or ros wines.  In addition to Greek dishes, youre just as likely to come across a Tunisian dish as a Balkan, Sicilian or Turkish one. Some of my favorite discoveries were the quince stuffed with wheat berries, nuts, and raisins, zucchini rolls stuffed with halloumi, and flatbread with dried figs, Roquefort cheese, and rosemary. The section on breads is excellent, including a homemade version of tortas de aceite as well as a pumpkin, tangerine, and marmalade bread. Desserts include a custardy orange and crumbled phyllo cake, rustic chocolates with dried figs, pistachios and toasted nuts and a quince spoon sweet I loved the spicy variation infused with ginger, allspice and cayenne.  Along the way, Kremezi imparts many fascinating stories into the origins of ingredients and techniques common to Mediterranean cuisines, and the stunning photography by Penny De Los Santos captures fresh produce, ingredients and dishes in a series of vibrant still lifes. The diverse Mediterranean vegetarian and vegan dishes featured within are sure to delight even the pickiest eater or devout carnivore. Sadly, all too often vegetarian main courses seem like an afterthought, but the recipes showcased in Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts are certain to become instant classics and bring vegetables and whole grains back into the spotlight where they belong.  Whether you are already vegetarian or are simply interested in the Mediterranean diet and eating more healthfully, Mediterranean Vegetarian Feasts deserves a place of honor in your cookbook collection.

Has a nice scent not overly strong and certainly better than a lot of the medical smelling ones. I deducted a star simply because I didnt really care for the way it feels on my hands, its a little stick and takes a while to dry. But, at this time of finding it difficult to locate hand sanitizers and Lysol, this is a great hand sanitizer to have around and the price is right, too."},

I wish it had come in a box it came bubble wrapped so it would be better for gift giving. Other than that, cute set of products."},
  {"id": 5787, "content": "Good Sound Quality | I dont usually like ear bud style headphones because they dont stay in place very well, even if just sitting. These have the sports clip feature which helps keep them in place. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price in my opinion. I did find that even with the clip, the actual ear buds did pop out every now and then. And as far as comfort, I found that I couldnt wear them for very long because they would start to annoy me. Thats not really a flaw in these specifically, I usually have this issue with all ear buds. Overall, I think these are pretty good, especially at this price point, but I will probably stick with over the ear style headphones for comfort."},
  {"id": 5788, "content": "Its ok... | To be totally honest, I am not a nursing mother and Im not expecting right now. But I came across this option when I was searching for nightgowns that had support in them and this particular colorsize option was very low around 1015, cant remember exactly how much compared to the others, and I thought it was cute. So I figured why not? I do have a gut right now and thought that the extra fabric wouldnt hurt anyway lol.  With that out of the way, if I were nursing, there is no way this would fit comfortably. Im about a 38C right now, a size 1618 overall. The size XL fit well enough, but it was kind of almost tight in the chest. I have nursed before, years ago, and I remember them getting larger and hard, and this would not be comfortable at all I dont think. I also dont think it fits much like a materinitypost birth nightgown would, the size in the torso is not much larger than regular nightgowns I already own. My overrall impression is that this is good, for the price. I wouldnt personally pay more than about 15 for it though. The ruffles dont seem super secure, I wouldnt be suprised if they came off after a few washes."},

Also has a cool light and can be paired with other doss speakers for fullerlouder sound. My review is based on the one DOSS party boom speaker. Its light weight which may save your arm but probably contributes to distortion if you try to crank the volume. My biggest grip is there is no battery level indicator. I have a ION block rocker that 20 more than this is currently selling for. It cam with a microphone and the sound is better cranked up. It also tells you how much battery is left. The only thing the DOSS has over the ION is the lights, weight its 20 cheaper. Do your research find out which one works best for you. If 20 is a too much and you need something lighter with cool lighting than this box may be for you."},

I am also impressed with how much better they fit when you swap out the silicone pieces for a better size. There are 3 different sizes and an extra of each size.

Once our grass began to grow in, 1 seed packet produced a minimal, spotty patch of grass.  It is mostly random stalks with a lot of space between.

Titles like From the Kitchen and ASIN1906868654 Sweet Home Over 100 Heritage Desserts and Ideas for Preserving Family Recipes take this trend one step further by combining cookbooks with genealogy by giving the reader hints and tips on how to interview family members and preserve treasured family recipes.  Twothirds of From the Family Kitchen is devoted to discussing and showcasing the evolution of American cuisine, from its early origins to postwar inventions that have shaped our food today. Youll find discussions on pioneers, how immigrants shaped American food, and how wartime rationing changed the way we cooked. Each chapter contains a fairly comprehensive bibliography. There are sample menus and quotes from vintage cookbooks, along with a large section devoted to community cookbooks. The discussion of collecting and preserving family recipes doesnt begin until page 80, with several lists of interview questions related to family history, kitchens, meals, etc. and advice on recording interviews from oldschool tape recorders to Skype recordings. Other online resources such as Google Books,  manuscript collections, online auctions, and the Periodical Source Index are discussed.  In Part Two, historical recipes are examined, including some crucial info on early cooking terms many derived from French, measurements including archaic ones like gills, wine glasses, and saucers, weights and measures, and cooking times and temperatures. Many very early cookbooks left out important steps, assuming that cooks of the day would instinctively know what to do. As for the historical recipes themselves, theres a little of everything, from Mountain Dew pudding to organ meats sweetbread salad, fried brains, kidney stew, assorted sides including the quirkilynamed rinktum diddy, and cakes and puddings sadly, none of these immediately piqued my interest, but to each his own. The final third of the book is an illustrated recipe journal, with each entry listing the recipe name, ingredients, directions, and memories of the recipe with space to post a photo of the dish or chef. At the back is a rather complete bibliography and list of resources.  From the Family Kitchen is a fascinating read into early American food and dining habits, but its format makes it a bit awkward to cook from for the heirloom recipes the font is on the small side, and the recipes are printed right on top of each other in paragraph format, and I found the included space for writing down recipes to be a bit cramped perhaps it was the illustrations, which extend a good 1 into the page on either side. The historical framing is fascinating, but I dont know that it would have much reread value for me.  However, this would be a good starting point for those looking to capture family recipes and cooking memories there are some useful interview questions for those who wish to build a family cookbook.  I also highly recommend Shutterflys cookbook templates, where you can easily create professionallooking photo cookbooks using your digital photos and typing recipes these make great family heirlooms or gifts."},

  {"id": 5950, "content": "Bedazzling CGI Is Not Enough | Reset is bigbudget Asian scifi, timetraveling, alternativetimeline movie with lots of big action scenes, car crashes, explosions, and quality CGI.  How could it not be a great movie?  It is not because the story is mainly a rehashing of decadesold scifi and timetravel tropes with few if any interesting twists.  It takes more than visual bedazzlement to make a movie great.  But what warrants my 1 star review is a very cheap and disturbing plot device used all too often in movies to villainize the villain and to heroize the hero.  And that is to put a child in danger.  This movie takes it way too far, showing a 5 yearold child kidnapped, crying, and later killed by a gunshot in slow motion no less.  And we see this depiction of the child endangered multiple times in different timelines.  This unpleasant aspect of the story is the primary reason I VETO this movie and advise others to skip it."},

However, with Lucky brand I always buy a 2x as it works best for me in the bust area.  Each brand runs a bit differently.  With Lucky I find a lot hinges on the material that is being used.  In this case, it wasnt material as much as I wanted to be able to extra room in the sleeves for long sleeved blouses underneath.  It worked perfectly in this case.  It is a navy print.  I like it with my jeans.  Just enough warmth... but not heavy.  Washed and dryed beautifully.  I never hesitate to update my review should new info seem useful."},

The flower design is pretty, but the wording isnt really child appropriate. Suck it Up Buttercup and drink your effing water is not something that I would want my young child to have. My youngest is now in college and that would be fine now, but these bottles are geared toward children. The water bottle has as straw which can be locked down. Theres a handle on the bottle.

  {"id": 5963, "content": "Halloween Fun! | Over the last few years, weve started accumulating outdoor inflatables for Halloween decorating. Our house is definitely the most decorated one during the month of October. What I really like about this one, is the shape. Its wide and short. Weve had some troubles with the tall skinny ones in the past. They tend to get knocked over during strong winds, even when staked to the ground. Of course, only time will tell with this one. But since its lower to the ground, I dont see that becoming a problem. It inflates easily. I set it up in the house and it is very wide! The noise it makes the fan is comparable to other inflatables. There are some LED lights inside. It only comes with 2 stakes, so hopefully that will be enough. The stakes are plastic, which is often more difficult to get into the ground. We have purchased extra metal ones just for our inflatables to make it easier.  It also comes with some rope. Now I must show some restraint and wait until closer to October before setting it up."},

First, I never heard of this brand before, so I hesitated to try it with one of my typical Sunday dinners but I am glad I did. Making a traditional slow cooker beef stew, I opened a can of the LoveSome Diced tomatoes and immediately could smell the difference between this variety and others. First, it is chock full of vegetables like tomatoes, celery, onions and peppers. The broth surrounding the vegetables is aromatic and really adds flavor to any dish. I had a slew of compliments at dinner from my brother and children asking me what I had done differently this time which made this stew different than before. I must admit, the stew was rich and flavorful and did taste better than usual. I highly recommend every house keeps a few cans of this LoveSome in the pantry for stews and soups as it really does make a savory difference in your recipes."},

I read somewhere in a review that you should always brew uuur tea for 3060 seconds and throw that tea out and then brew it the desired amount of time.  Yes, it removes about 90 of the caffeine, but it leaves such a very smooth tasting tea behind.  Sometimes I just mix all 3 brews together in one big Lifefactory glass jar and drink it that way throughout the day. Others I just drink them one after the other. Its yummy tea."},

Her waist measures at 29.5 inches. I decided to go with the large here after reading their sizing guide. I didnt want it to be too tight on her. Well, I should have gone with the medium. The large is a little loose on her  not to the point of it falling off, but its at least a good inch, possibly more, too big in the waist. The skirt hangs really cute on her. She really loves the way it looks. There is no hem  the bottom of the dress is just a cut edge. The fabric doesnt wrinkle. This will be great for school.
